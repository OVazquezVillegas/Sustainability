THIS FEATURE IS GRADUALLY BEING EXPLOITED BY RESEARCHERS IN GENETIC AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS THAT UTILIZE BANKED BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND IN STUDIES WHERE TIME, COST AND ETHICS ARE PROMINENT CONSIDERATIONS. RECENT WORK IN THIS AREA HAS FOCUSSED ON THE SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS OF MATCHED CASE-CONTROL STUDIES WITH A DICHOTOMOUS TRAIT. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXTEND THE SEQUENTIAL APPROACH TO A COMPARISON OF THE ASSOCIATIONS WITHIN TWO INDEPENDENT GROUPS OF PAIRED CONTINUOUS OBSERVATIONS. SUCH A COMPARISON IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN FAMILIAL STUDIES OF PHENOTYPIC CORRELATION USING TWINS. WE DEVELOP A SEQUENTIAL TWIN METHOD BASED ON THE INTRACLASS CORRELATION AND SHOW THAT USE OF SEQUENTIAL METHODOLOGY CAN LEAD TO A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE STUDY ERROR RATES. ADDITIONALLY, OUR APPROACH PERMITS STRAIGHTFORWARD ALLOWANCE FOR OTHER EXPLANATORY FACTORS IN THE ANALYSIS. WE ILLUSTRATE OUR METHOD IN A SEQUENTIAL HERITABILITY STUDY OF DYSPLASIA THAT ALLOWS FOR THE EFFECT OF BODY MASS INDEX AND COMPARES MONOZYGOTES WITH PAIRS OF SINGLETON SISTERS.

AN IDEALIZED MODEL IS USED THAT CONSISTS OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL SHALLOW WATER EQUATIONS AND SEDIMENT MASS BALANCE. CONDITIONS ARE ASSUMED TO BE UNIFORM IN THE ALONG-ESTUARY DIRECTION. A SEMIDIURNAL TIDAL DISCHARGE AND TIDALLY AVERAGED DENSITY GRADIENTS ARE PRESCRIBED. THE EROSIONAL SEDIMENT FLUX AT THE BED DEPENDS BOTH ON THE BED SHEAR STRESS AND ON THE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT AVAILABLE IN MUD REACHES FOR RESUSPENSION. THE DISTRIBUTION OF MUD REACHES OVER THE BED IS SELECTED SUCH THAT SEDIMENT TRANSPORT IS IN MORPHODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM, THAT IS, TIDALLY AVERAGED EROSION AND DEPOSITION OF SEDIMENT AT THE BED BALANCE. ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS ARE OBTAINED BY USING PERTURBATION ANALYSIS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IN MOST ESTUARIES LATERAL DENSITY GRADIENTS INDUCE MORE SEDIMENT TRANSPORT THAN CORIOLIS FORCING. WHEN FRICTIONAL FORCES ARE SMALL (EKMAN NUMBER E < 0.02), THE CORIOLIS MECHANISM DOMINATES AND ACCUMULATES SEDIMENT ON THE RIGHT BANK ( LOOKING UP-ESTUARY IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE). ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN FRICTIONAL FORCES ARE MODERATE TO HIGH ( E > 0.02), THE LATERAL DENSITY GRADIENT MECHANISM DOMINATES AND ENTRAPS SEDIMENT IN AREAS WITH FRESHER WATER. RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE LATERAL SEDIMENT TRANSPORT INDUCED BY THE SEMIDIURNAL TIDAL FLOW IS SIGNIFICANT WHEN FRICTIONAL FORCES ARE SMALL ( E SIMILAR TO 0.02).

HOWEVER, THE LACK OF SPATIALLY RESOLVED SIMULATION MODELS HAMPERS THE QUANTIFICATION OF HOLOCENE CARBON ACCUMULATION OF THE ENTIRE MIRE SYSTEMS. HERE WE DEVELOPED A THREE-DIMENSIONAL DYNAMIC MODEL, BASED ON A HYDROLOGICAL APPROACH. WE APPLIED THE MODEL TO A LARGE MIRE COMPLEX IN WESTERN SIBERIA TO SIMULATE ITS HOLOCENE DEVELOPMENT AND TO QUANTIFY THE LONG-TERM CARBON ACCUMULATION RATE (LORCA). OUR MODEL SIMULATED A LORCA WITH A SPATIAL VARIATION OF 10-85 G C M(-2) YR(-1). THE AVERAGE OVER THE HOLOCENE WAS 16.2 G C M(-2) YR(-1). SIMULATION SCENARIOS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY SHOW THAT THE AVERAGE LORCA DROPPED TO 5.2 G C M(-2) YR(-1) BECAUSE OF OXIDATION AND DECOMPOSITION OF PEAT FOLLOWING MIRE DRAINAGE AFTER THE 1950S. EVEN IN THE UNDRAINED PARTS OF THE MIRE COMPLEX THE LORCA IS LOWERED SUBSTANTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE DROPPED WATER TABLE AND RESULTING DECREASE IN PEAT GROWTH. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT CARBON ACCUMULATION IN WESTERN SIBERIAN WATERSHED MIRES WILL CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE.

BECAUSE WATER IMMERSION PRODUCES A MARKED CENTRAL REDISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD VOLUME AND SUPPRESSES THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM RESPONSE AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT WATER IMMERSION MIGHT BE USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF PREECLAMPSIA. STUDY DESIGN: THE EFFECTS OF THERMONEUTRAL WATER IMMERSION FOR 3 HOURS ON CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL HEMODYNAMICS WERE EVALUATED IN 7 PREECLAMPTIC PATIENTS, 7 NORMAL PREGNANT CONTROL PATIENTS, AND 7 NONPREGNANT WOMEN. FINGER PLETHYSMOGRAPHY WAS USED TO DETERMINE HEMODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS (CARDIAC OUTPUT AND TOTAL PERIPHERAL RESISTANCE), AND FOREARM BLOOD FLOW WAS MEASURED BY STRAIN GAUGE PLETHYSMOGRAPHY. POSTISCHEMIC HYPEREMIA WAS USED TO DETERMINE ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATION. ANALYSIS WAS BY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOR REPEATED MEASUREMENTS. RESULTS: DURING WATER IMMERSION CARDIAC OUTPUT INCREASED WHILE DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE DECREASED, ALTHOUGH SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE REMAINED UNCHANGED IN EACH GROUP. FOREARM BLOOD FLOW INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL PREGNANT AND PREECLAMPTIC SUBJECTS. TOTAL PERIPHERAL RESISTANCE DECREASED IN ALL GROUPS, BUT VALUES IN PREECLAMPTIC PATIENTS REMAINED ABOVE THOSE. OF NORMOTENSIVE PREGNANT WOMEN. WATER IMMERSION HAD NO EFFECT ON ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATION IN THE PREECLAMPTIC GROUP, AND MOST HEMODYNAMIC CHANGES THAT WERE OBSERVED REVERSED TO BASELINE WITHIN 2 HOURS OF COMPLETION OF THE PROCEDURE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH WATER IMMERSION RESULTS IN HEMODYNAMIC ALTERATIONS IN A MANNER THAT IS THEORETICALLY THERAPEUTIC FOR WOMEN WITH PREECLAMPSIA, THE EFFECT WAS LIMITED AND SHORT-LIVED. IN ADDITION WATER IMMERSION HAD NO EFFECT ON ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATION IN WOMEN WITH PREECLAMPSIA. THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL FOR WATER IMMERSION IN PREECLAMPSIA APPEARS TO BE LIMITED.

THEREFORE, A WASTE TREATMENT STRUCTURE SHOULD BE DESIGNED FOR AN EFFICIENT SAVING OF FOSSIL PRIMARY ENERGY IN TERMS OF MAXIMAL PRIMARY ENERGY SAVINGS OR MINIMAL COSTS PER UNIT OF PRIMARY ENERGY SAVINGS. HOWEVER, THIS IS A COMPLEX TASK, GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGIES, RECYCLING OPTIONS AND THEIR LOGISTIC CONSEQUENCES, THAT NECESSITATE AN INTEGRATED ANALYSIS. ALSO, ON LONGER TERM VARIOUS NEW AND IMPROVED TECHNOLOGIES BECOME AVAILABLE WHICH CAN AFFECT PERFORMANCES FOR OPTIONS FROM AN ECONOMIC AND/OR ENERGY POINT OF VIEW. FOR THAT REASON, AN OPTIMISATION TOOL, THAT OPTIMISES A BIOMASS AND WASTE TREATMENT SYSTEM FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF BIOMASS AND WASTE, IS DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY. THIS OPTIMAL BIOMASS AND WASTE TREATMENT SYSTEM IS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL TREATMENT INSTALLATIONS, THAT ARE CHARACTERISED BY SCALE, LOCATION AND KIND OF TECHNOLOGY. IMPORTANT ASPECTS THAT ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE ANALYSIS ARE HEAT DISTRIBUTION, BIOMASS AND WASTE TRANSPORT AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE. A BROAD VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGIES FOR MATERIAL RECYCLING, CONVERSION OF BIOMASS AND/OR WASTE TO HEAT, ELECTRICITY OR TRANSPORTATION FUEL ARE INCLUDED IN THE OPTIMISATION TOOL. PERFORMANCE DATA OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW. EXAMPLES OF INCLUDED TECHNOLOGIES COMPRISE: INTEGRATED GASIFICATION WITH COMBINED CYCLE, WASTE INCINERATION, PYROLYSIS, DIGESTION, CO-FIRING IN FOSSIL POWER PLANTS, BIOMASS INCINERATION, HYDRO-THERMAL UPGRADING, PAPER RECYCLING AND CHIPBOARD PRODUCTION. A COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES IN RELATION TO SCALE SHOWS THAT PRIMARY ENERGY SAVINGS AND COSTS PER UNIT OF PRIMARY ENERGY SAVINGS DIVERGE SIGNIFICANTLY. IN GENERAL, THE OPTIMISATION TOOL DEVELOPED HERE IS SUITABLE FOR ANALYSES OF OPTIMAL BIOMASS AND WASTE TREATMENT STRUCTURES IN DIFFERENT REGIONS WITH REGARD TO PRIMARY ENERGY SAVINGS AND THEIR COSTS. BY MEANS OF SCENARIO ANALYSIS, ROBUST OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF PRIMARY ENERGY SAVINGS AND THEIR COSTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND THE INFLUENCE OF IMPORTANT PARAMETERS CAN BE ANALYSED.

AS A RESULT THE 'SPACE FOR RIVERS' PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED, AIMING AT RESTORING PHYSICAL SPACE FOR THE RIVERS IN COMBINATION WITH ECOLOGICAL REHABILITATION. HOWEVER, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIES-RICH VEGETATION TYPES IN THESE FLOODPLAIN AREAS IS LAGGING BEHIND RESTORATION TARGETS AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CONSTRAINTS MAY PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THIS. BIOGEOCHEMICAL, HYDROLOGICAL AND VEGETATION DATA WERE COLLECTED IN I I I PLOTS IN BOTH REHABILITATED AND ORIGINAL FLOODPLAINS IN REGULATED AND MORE PRISTINE RIVER SYSTEMS IN THE NETHERLANDS AND POLAND. SOIL NUTRIENT AND SOIL PORE WATER DATA WERE SUMMARIZED BY FACTOR ANALYSIS AND THE SUBSEQUENT PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS WERE COMPARED TO VEGETATION AND HYDROLOGICAL DATA BY CORRELATION ANALYSIS. THE CORRELATION ANALYSES BETWEEN VEGETATION PARAMETERS INCLUDING NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY AND THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL SOIL VARIABLES RESULTED IN A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRISTINE AND IMPACTED RIVER SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST A CLEAR N-LIMITATION OF PLANT GROWTH IN PRISTINE FLOODPLAINS, AND APPARENT ABSENCE OF LIMITATION IN REGULATED, IMPACTED FLOODPLAINS. IN ADDITION, RESULTS INDICATE THAT FLOODING EVENTS DO NOT LEAD TO ONE-WAY TRANSPORT OF SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE RIVER INTO THE FLOODPLAINS; RATHER THEY INDICATE THAT HIGHLY DYNAMIC HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVENT SOILS FROM ACCUMULATING ORGANIC MATTER AND NUTRIENTS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT NUTRIENT LIMITATION IN REGULATED FLOODPLAINS SHIFTED FROM DISTINCTLY N-LIMITED PLANT GROWTH TO NO NUTRIENT LIMITATION AT ALL, PROBABLY DUE TO DECADES OF HIGH FERTILIZER AND MANURE APPLICATION AND NUTRIENT INPUT BY THE RIVERS DURING FLOODING. THE CONSEQUENCE OF OUR FINDINGS FOR REHABILITATION ACTIVITIES IS THAT IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO RESTORE NITROGEN LIMITATION IN FLOODPLAIN SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A SPECIES-RICH FLOODPLAIN VEGETATION, THROUGH NUTRIENT REMOVAL BY HAYMAKING.

WE ASK WHETHER THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE VERBAL INTERACTION OF DUTCH GPS WITH IMMIGRANT AND DUTCH PATIENTS. DATA WERE DRAWN FROM 144 ADULT PATIENT INTERVIEWS AND VIDEO OBSERVATIONS OF CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE PATIENTS AND 31 DUTCH GPS. THE PATIENT GROUP CONSISTED OF 61 NON-WESTERN IMMIGRANTS (TURKISH, MOROCCAN, SURINAMESE, ANTILLEAN, CAPE VERDIAN) AND 83 DUTCH PARTICIPANTS. AFFECTIVE AND INSTRUMENTAL ASPECTS OF VERBAL COMMUNICATION WERE ASSESSED USING ROTER'S INTERACTION ANALYSIS SYSTEM (RIAS). PATIENTS' CULTURAL BACKGROUND WAS ASSESSED BY ETHNICITY, LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY, LEVEL OF EDUCATION, RELIGIOSITY AND CULTURAL VIEWS (IN TERMS OF BEING MORE TRADITIONAL OR MORE MODERN). CONSULTATIONS WITH THE NON-WESTERN IMMIGRANT PATIENTS (ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM TURKEY AND MOROCCO) WERE WELL OVER 2 MIN SHORTER, AND THE POWER DISTANCE BETWEEN GPS AND THESE PATIENTS WAS GREATER WHEN COMPARED TO THE DUTCH PATIENTS. MAJOR DIFFERENCES IN VERBAL INTERACTION WERE OBSERVED ON THE AFFECTIVE BEHAVIOR DIMENSIONS, BUT NOT ON THE INSTRUMENTAL DIMENSIONS. DOCTORS INVESTED MORE IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE IMMIGRANT PATIENTS, WHILE IN THE CASE OF DUTCH PATIENTS THEY SHOWED MORE INVOLVEMENT AND EMPATHY. DUTCH PATIENTS SEEMED TO BE MORE ASSERTIVE IN THE MEDICAL CONVERSATION. THE DIFFERENCES ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF PATIENTS' ETHNIC BACKGROUND, CULTURAL VIEWS (E.G. PRACTICING A RELIGION) AND LINGUISTIC BARRIERS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ATTENTION TO CULTURAL DIVERSITY DOES MATTER, AS THIS LEADS TO DIFFERENT MEDICAL COMMUNICATION PATTERNS. A TWO-WAY STRATEGY IS RECOMMENDED FOR IMPROVING MEDICAL COMMUNICATION, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH DOCTOR AND PATIENT BEHAVIOR. (C) 2006 ELSEVIER LTD.

BECAUSE OF AN INCREASED RISK OF PNEUMONIA IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES, WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF STATIN USE ON THE OCCURRENCE OF PNEUMONIA IN ADULT DIABETIC PATIENTS. METHODS: ALL PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES ( TYPES 1 AND 2) ENLISTED IN THE UK GENERAL PRACTICE RESEARCH DATABASE BETWEEN 1 JUNE 1987 AND 21 JANUARY 2001 WERE INCLUDED. A CASE-CONTROL STUDY WAS PERFORMED WITH CASES DEFINED AS PATIENTS WITH A FIRST RECORDED DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA. FOR EACH CASE UP TO FOUR CONTROLS WERE MATCHED BY AGE, SEX, PRACTICE, AND INDEX DATE. PATIENTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT USERS WHEN THE INDEX DATE WAS BETWEEN THE START AND END DATE OF STATIN TREATMENT. CONDITIONAL MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THE STRENGTH OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STATIN TREATMENT AND THE OCCURRENCE OF PNEUMONIA. RESULTS: STATINS WERE USED IN 1.1% OF 4719 CASES AND IN 2.1% OF 15 322 MATCHED CONTROLS ( CRUDE ODDS RATIO ( OR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 TO 0.68). AFTER ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS, TREATMENT WITH STATINS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE RISK OF PNEUMONIA ( ADJUSTED OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.35 TO 0.69). THE ASSOCIATION WAS CONSISTENT AMONG RELEVANT SUBGROUPS ( CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, PULMONARY DISEASES) AND INDEPENDENT OF THE USE OF OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. CONCLUSIONS: THE USE OF STATINS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION IN THE RISK OF PNEUMONIA IN DIABETIC PATIENTS. IN ADDITION TO LOWERING THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, STATINS MAY BE USEFUL IN PREVENTING RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS.","COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA; POPULATION-BASED COHORT; INFLUENZA VACCINES; SOCIAL-CLASS; MORTALITY; SEPSIS; DRUGS; INFLAMMATION; POSTCODES; ACCURACY",NA,"THORAX","VAN DE GARDE, EMW##HAK, E##SOUVEREIN, PC##HOES, AW##VAN DEN BOSCH, JMM##LEUFKENS, HGM","UIPS, DEPT PHARMACOEPIDEMIOL & PHARMACOTHERAPY, NL-3583 CA UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS.

"J","WOS:000242628300012","2006","THE IMPACT OF BIOTURBATION BY SMALL MAMMALS ON HEAVY METAL REDISTRIBUTION IN AN EMBANKED FLOODPLAIN OF THE RIVER RHINE","FLOODPLAINS ALONG LARGE EUROPEAN RIVERS ARE DIFFUSELY POLLUTED WITH HEAVY METALS DUE TO EMISSIONS IN THE PAST. BECAUSE OF LOW MOBILITY OF HEAVY METALS IN FLOODPLAIN SOILS AND IMPROVEMENTS OF WATER QUALITY, THESE POLLUTANTS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE, AND CAN GRADUALLY BECOME COVERED WITH LESS CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS. BIOTURBATORS, ESPECIALLY EARTHWORMS, CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE MIXING AND SURFACING OF CONTAMINATED SUBSTRATE. SURFACED SUBSTRATE CAN BE REDISTRIBUTED BY RECURRENT FLOODING EVENTS, EVEN TO AREAS OUTSIDE THE FLOODPLAIN. THE QUESTION REMAINED TO WHAT EXTENT BIOTURBATION BY SMALL MAMMALS CONTRIBUTES TO THE REDISTRIBUTION OF HEAVY METALS FROM RIVER SEDIMENTS IN FLOODPLAINS. EXTENSIVE FIELDWORK ON BIOTURBATORS SUCH AS VOLES, MOLES AND EARTHWORMS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS, AS WELL AS ON SEDIMENT DEPOSITION AND BIOTURBATION, WAS CONDUCTED AT THE 'AFFERDENSCHE EN DEESTSCHE WAARDEN' FLOODPLAIN OVER THE YEARS 2001-2003. FIELD DATA WERE COMBINED WITH DATA OF EXPERIMENTS IN FIELD ENCLOSURES AND SUBSTRATE COLUMNS TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNTS OF SEDIMENT AND HEAVY METALS (ZN, CU, PB AND CD) REDISTRIBUTED DURING THE FLOODS AS WELL AS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. MOLES AND VOLES SURFACED CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF SUBSTRATE AND HEAVY METALS, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS EARTHWORMS WHICH CONTRIBUTE A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL DEPOSITION AND REDISTRIBUTION DURING FLOODS. ALTHOUGH THE IMPACT OF MOLES AND VOLES ON THE REDISTRIBUTION DURING FLOODS WAS ONLY LOCALLY IMPORTANT, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THE BIOTURBATION ACTIVITY OF ESPECIALLY MOLES IN FLOODPLAINS CANNOT BE NEGLECTED. THE ANNUAL AMOUNTS OF SUBSTRATE AND HEAVY METALS SURFACED BY ALL INVESTIGATED BIOTURBATORS WERE EVEN LARGER THAN THE TOTAL AMOUNTS OF SUBSTRATE AND HEAVY METALS DEPOSITED DURING FLOODS.","ECOLOGICAL RISK-ASSESSMENT; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; SEDIMENTATION; SOIL; EARTHWORMS","BIOTURBATION; EARTHWORMS; FLOODPLAINS; HEAVY METALS; MOLES; REDISTRIBUTION; SEDIMENT; SMALL MAMMALS; VOLES","WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION","WIJNHOVEN, S##THONON, I##VAN DER VELDE, G##LEUVEN, R##ZORN, M##EIJSACKERS, H##SMITS, T","RADBOUD UNIV NIJMEGEN, FAC SCI, CTR WATER & SOC, NL-6500 GL NIJMEGEN, NETHERLANDS.

ORAL TOLERANCE INDUCTION AND THE SUBSEQUENT ACTIVATION OF REGULATORY T CELLS MAY BE AN ADEQUATE THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS. METHODS AND RESULTS - TOLERANCE TO OXLDL AND MALONDIALDEHYDE-TREATED LDL ( MDA-LDL) WAS INDUCED IN LDL RECEPTOR(-/-) MICE FED A WESTERN-TYPE DIET BY ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF OXLDL OR MDA-LDL BEFORE THE INDUCTION OF ATHEROGENESIS. ORAL TOLERANCE TO OXLDL RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT ATTENUATION OF THE INITIATION ( 30% TO 71%; P < 0.05) AND PROGRESSION ( 45%; P < 0.05) OF ATHEROGENESIS. TOLERANCE TO OXLDL INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) CELLS IN SPLEEN AND MESENTERIC LYMPH NODES, AND THESE CELLS SPECIFICALLY RESPONDED TO OXLDL WITH INCREASED TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA PRODUCTION. TOLERANCE TO OXLDL ALSO INCREASED THE MRNA EXPRESSION OF FOXP3, CTLA-4, AND CD25 IN THE PLAQUE. IN CONTRAST, TOLERANCE TO MDA-LDL DID NOT AFFECT ATHEROGENESIS. CONCLUSIONS - OXLDL-SPECIFIC T CELLS, PRESENT IN LDL RECEPTOR(-/-) MICE AND IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS IN THE IMMUNE RESPONSE LEADING TO ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE, CAN BE COUNTERACTED BY OXLDL-SPECIFIC CD4(+)D25(+)FOXP3(+) REGULATORY T CELLS ACTIVATED VIA ORAL TOLERANCE INDUCTION TO OXLDL.
