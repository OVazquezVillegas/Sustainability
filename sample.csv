HOWEVER, AS THE DOMESTIC ENERGY DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE AND THE ABILITIES TO EXPAND HYDROPOWER CAPACITY IN BRAZIL ARE CONSTRAINED, IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCREASE THE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES. CONSIDERING THE HIGH THEORETICAL POTENTIAL AND MATURE CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES, BIOELECTRICITY FROM SUGARCANE STRAW COULD BE A PROMISING OPTION. OUR STUDY AIMS TO ASSESS THE BIOELECTRICITY POTENTIAL FROM ECOLOGICALLY AVAILABLE SUGARCANE STRAW IN THE STATE OF SAO PAULO (BRAZIL) AT MULTIPLE SCALES FOR THE 2012 CROP-YEAR. WE USE A SPATIALLY EXPLICIT APPROACH TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SUGARCANE FIELDS, THE SPATIAL VARIATION OF SUGARCANE YIELD, THE LOCATION AND THE MILLING DATA OF EACH MILL. WE DEFINE A BUSINESS AS USUAL, A MODERATE AND A HIGH SCENARIO ON THE AMOUNT OF STRAW THAT CAN BE REMOVED GIVEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS. THE BIOELECTRICITY POTENTIAL FROM ECOLOGICALLY AVAILABLE SUGARCANE STRAW IS ESTIMATED BETWEEN 18.7 AND 45.8 TWH IN SAO PAULO, EQUAL TO 2237% OF THE ELECTRICITY DEMAND. THE RESULTS SHOW LARGE GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES, WITH GENERALLY HIGHER POTENTIALS AND SHORTER COLLECTION RADIUSES FOR THE MILLS IN THE TRADITIONAL SUGARCANE AREAS COMPARED TO THE MILLS IN THE EXPANSION AREAS. WE CONCLUDE THAT BIOELECTRICITY FROM SUGARCANE STRAW COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IN BRAZIL.

PALEOCLIMATOLOGY","MICROFOSSILS FROM PLANKTON ARE USED FOR PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTIONS. AN OFTEN-MADE ASSUMPTION IN QUANTITATIVE MICROPLANKTON-BASED PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTIONS IS THAT SEDIMENTARY ASSEMBLAGES REPRESENT CONDITIONS OF THE DIRECTLY OVERLYING SURFACE WATER. HOWEVER, ANY IMMOBILE PARTICLE SINKING DOWN THE WATER COLUMN IS SUBJECTED TO TRANSPORT BY THREE-DIMENSIONAL CURRENTS, WHICH RESULTS IN A LATERAL RELOCATION ALONG TRANSPORT. WE MODEL DINOFLAGELLATE CYST (DINOCYST) TRANSPORT IN A HIGH-RESOLUTION (0.1 HORIZONTALLY) GLOBAL MODEL OF THE PRESENT-DAY OCEAN AND COMPARE OCEAN CONDITIONS IN THE SIMULATED ORIGIN OF SEDIMENTARY PARTICLES TO THAT IN THE DIRECTLY OVERLYING WATER. WE FIND THAT THE ASSUMPTION THAT SEDIMENTARY PARTICLES REPRESENT THE OVERLYING SURFACE WATERS IS IN MOST REGIONS NOT VALID. THE BIAS INDUCED BY DINOCYST TRANSPORT DEPENDS ON OCEAN CURRENT STRENGTH AND DIRECTION, AGGREGATION OF PARTICLES WHICH COULD INCREASE THE SINKING SPEED, AND THE SEDIMENT SAMPLE DEPTH. BY USING REALISTIC SINKING SPEEDS OF DINOCYSTS AND AGGREGATES, EXTREME BIASES UP TO APPROXIMATELY 16C WARMER OR 4PSU SALTIER ARE FOUND, WHILE OTHER REGIONS SHOW LOWER BIAS FROM PARTICLE TRANSPORT. OUR MODEL RESULTS PROVIDE A WAY TO MECHANISTICALLY AND STATISTICALLY EXPLAIN THE UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCES OF SOME DINOCYST SPECIES OUTSIDE OF THEIR NORMAL OCCURRENCE REGION, SUCH AS THE NORTHERLY OCCURRENCE OF THE ALLEGEDLY SEA-ICE-AFFILIATED DINOCYST SELENOPEMPHIX ANTARCTICA. EXCLUSION OF SUCH OUTLIER OCCURRENCES WILL YIELD BETTER CONSTRAINED ECOLOGICAL AFFINITES FOR DINOCYST SPECIES, WHICH HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR MICROFOSSIL-BASED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE PROXIES FOR PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS. WE RECOMMEND PALEOCEANOGRAPHERS TO A PRIORI EVALUATE THE (PALEO)WATER DEPTH, OCEANOGRAPHIC SETTING, CURRENT STRENGTH, AND PARTICLE AGGREGATION PROBABILITY FOR THEIR SEDIMENTARY MICROPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES. 2019.

IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON EUROPEAN BREEDS OF BEEF CATTLE (BOS TAURUS TAURUS) IN TEMPERATE CLIMATE ZONES, INDIVIDUAL RECORDS OF BODY WEIGHT AND WELFARE INDICATORS WERE OBTAINED FROM 130 BEEF CATTLE. THESE BELONGED TO FOUR HERDS AND WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO TWO CONTIGUOUS PLOTS: SILVOPASTORAL SYSTEMS (SPS) AND OPEN PASTURES SYSTEMS (OPS). THE SPS IN THIS STUDY WERE AREAS WITH EXOTIC TREES OF EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS GLOBULUS FOR PAPER PULP PRODUCTION PLANTED IN A 2 2 DESIGN (TWO METERS BETWEEN EACH TREE) OVER DIVERSE, NATIVE GRASSES. THE OPS WERE LARGE OPEN AREAS WITH A GREAT DIVERSITY OF NATIVE GRASSES, HERBS, AND SMALL PLOTS OF TREES WHERE THE ANIMALS COULD REST AND SHELTER FROM EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. OVER THE COURSE OF ONE YEAR, INDIVIDUAL BODY WEIGHTS AND A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC ANIMAL WELFARE INDICATORS WERE MEASURED EVERY 45 DAYS. AFTER A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS, A GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODEL (GLMM) WITH A GAUSSIAN DISTRIBU-TION, WITH TIME AND SYSTEM (OPS OR SPS) FITTED AS FIXED EFFECTS AND INDIVIDUALS NESTED BY HERD AS RANDOM INTERCEPTS, WAS USED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT WEIGHT GAIN DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS. NONE OF THE ANIMALS SHOWED ANY SIGN OF IMPAIRED WELFARE IN EITHER SYSTEM OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. SILVOPASTORAL SYSTEMS OFFER ANIMALS A SUSTAINABLE AND RICHER ENVIRONMENT THAT WILL IMPROVES THEIR WELFARE. THE ADDITIONAL INCOME PROVIDED BY THE WOOD PRODUCTION ALLOWS THE FARMERS TO MAIN-TAIN THEIR TRADITIONAL CATTLE FARMING LIFESTYLE. 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

MANAGE.","UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES IN URBAN MANAGEMENT OF WATER, WASTE AND CLIMATE CHANGEAMPLIFIED BY URBANISATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTHARE GROWING IN ASIA. IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, CITIES NEED TO BE AWARE OF THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR CAPACITY IN ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES PRIORITIES, BARRIERS AND ENABLERS OF THESE CAPACITIES. THROUGH THE CITY BLUEPRINT APPROACHAN INTEGRATED BASELINE ASSESSMENT OF THE URBAN WATER CYCLE11 ASIAN CITIES ARE ASSESSED. THREE CITIES ARE SELECTED FOR AN IN-DEPTH GOVERNANCE CAPACITY ANALYSIS OF THEIR CHALLENGES WITH A FOCUS ON FLOODS. SOLID WASTE COLLECTION AND TREATMENT AND ACCESS TO IMPROVED DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION CAN BE CONSIDERED PRIORITIES, ESPECIALLY IN CITIES WITH CONSIDERABLE SLUM POPULATIONS. THESE PEOPLE ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE-RELATED HAZARDS. THE HIGH VARIATION OF WATER MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE AMONG ASIAN CITIES SHOWS HIGH POTENTIAL FOR CITY-TO-CITY LEARNING BY SHARING BEST PRACTICES IN WATER TECHNOLOGY AND GOVERNANCE. COMBINING INTERVENTIONS, I.E., BY EXPLORING CO-BENEFITS WITH OTHER SECTORS (E.G., TRANSPORT AND ENERGY) WILL INCREASE EFFICIENCY, IMPROVE RESILIENCE, AND LOWER THE COST. ALTHOUGH GOVERNANCE CAPACITIES VARIED AMONG CITIES, MANAGEMENT OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION SHOWED TO BE REOCCURRING POINTS FOR IMPROVEMENT. CITIES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO INCREASE IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITIES USING BETTER POLICY, STRICTER COMPLIANCE AND PREPAREDNESS NEXT TO PROMOTING COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. CONSEQUENTLY, THE CITY TRANSFORMATION PROCESS CAN BE MORE CONCRETE, EFFICIENT AND INCLUSIVE. 2019, THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,"EMNGD","VAN LEEUWEN, K.; COPERNICUS INSTITUTE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: KEES.VAN.LEEUWEN@KWRWATER.NL","ARTICLE","10.1007/s00267-019-01137-y",NA,NA,"0364152X","ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","ENGLISH",14,"4",NA,"520-535","SPRINGER NEW YORK LLC","30796465","SCOPUS","OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES OF WATER, WASTE AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN ASIAN CITIES","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062024740&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-019-01137-y&partnerID=40&md5=aaf8db1311073c729b70c63d119e92b6","63",2019,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH;INNER MONGOLIA UNIVERSITY;NANKAI UNIVERSITY;HONGIK UNIVERSITY;KWR WATERCYCLE RESEARCH INSTITUTE","NOTREPORTED;COPERNICUS INSTITUTE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION;NOTREPORTED",NA,"RAHMASARY AN, 2019, ENVIRON MANAGE","RAHMASARY AN, 2019, ENVIRON MANAGE"

STUDYING THE ULTRASTRUCTURE OF GAMETES IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THEIR INTERACTIONS, AND HOW TO MANIPULATE THEM IN ORDER TO EITHER ENCOURAGE OR PREVENT THEIR UNION. HERE, WE SURVEY THE PROMINENT ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (EM) TECHNIQUES, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CONSIDERATIONS FOR APPLYING THEM TO STUDY MAMMALIAN GAMETES. WE REVIEW HOW CONVENTIONAL EM HAS PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT INSIGHT INTO GAMETE ULTRASTRUCTURE, BUT ALSO HOW THE HARSH SAMPLE PREPARATION METHODS REQUIRED PRECLUDE UNDERSTANDING AT A TRULY MOLECULAR LEVEL. WE PRESENT RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN CRYO-ELECTRON TOMOGRAPHY THAT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMAGE CELLS IN A NEAR-NATIVE STATE AND AT UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF DETAIL. NEW AND EMERGING CELLULAR EM TECHNIQUES ARE POISED TO REKINDLE EXPLORATION OF FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS IN MAMMALIAN REPRODUCTION, ESPECIALLY PHENOMENA THAT INVOLVE COMPLEX MEMBRANE REMODELLING AND PROTEIN REORGANIZATION. THESE METHODS WILL ALSO ALLOW NOVEL LINES OF ENQUIRY INTO PROBLEMS OF PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE, SUCH AS INVESTIGATING UNEXPLAINED CAUSES OF HUMAN INFERTILITY AND IMPROVING ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. 2020 THE AUTHORS.","200186",NA,"ZEEV-BEN-MORDEHAI, T.; CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: Z.ZEEV@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1098/rsob.200186",NA,NA,"20462441","OPEN BIOLOGY","ENGLISH",0,"9",NA,NA,"ROYAL SOCIETY PUBLISHING","32931719","SCOPUS","LOOKING BACK AND LOOKING FORWARD: CONTRIBUTIONS OF ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TO THE STRUCTURAL CELL BIOLOGY OF GAMETES AND FERTILIZATION: ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IN FERTILISATION","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091055255&doi=10.1098%2frsob.200186&partnerID=40&md5=35a768bee02d7f983a9a042e298da51e","10",2020,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD","NOTREPORTED;CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"RAVI RT, 2020, OPEN BIOL","RAVI RT, 2020, OPEN BIOL"

WASHINGTON, DC: WORLD RESOURCES INSTITUE (2014) ISBN 978-1-56973-840-","ENERGY EFFIC.","IN 2008, THE DUTCH VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ON INDUSTRIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY FACED FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO THEIR MONITORING METHODOLOGY. WHERE THE OLD METHOD WAS BASED ON MEASURING THE IMPROVEMENT OF ENERGY USE PER UNIT OF PRODUCTION, THE NEW METHOD FOCUSES ON THE ENERGY SAVINGS FROM PROJECTS IMPLEMENTED BY PARTICIPATING COMPANIES. ADVOCATES OF THE NEW METHOD CLAIM THAT IT GIVES A BETTER VIEW OF THE COMPANIES EFFORTS TO SAVE ENERGY, AS IT SHOWS THEIR DELIBERATE CHANGES IN PRODUCTION PROCESSES, WHEREAS OPPONENTS EMPHASISE THAT THE RELATION WITH REAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS LOST. BY APPLYING THE TWO METHODS ON THE SAME GROUP OF COMPANIES, THE RESULTS CAN BE COMPARED AND SHOW TO WHAT EXTENT THE CHOICE OF MONITORING METHOD AFFECTS THE KEY MESSAGE TO POLICY MAKERS. OF SPECIAL INTEREST IS THE RELATION BETWEEN ENERGY AND PRODUCTION IN THE PERIOD 20082012, A PERIOD WITH LARGE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION AND ENERGY USE AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE DATA SHOW THAT ENERGY-SAVING PROJECTS MADE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ENERGY USE IN THE ANALYSIS PERIOD, ALTHOUGH THEIR EFFECT IS SMALLER THAN THAT OF OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN PRODUCTION AND IN THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING COMPANIES. THE OLD METHOD SHOWS A RESULT FOR THE PERIOD 20052013 THAT IS LESS THAN HALF OF THAT OF THE NEW METHOD, MAINLY BECAUSE OF A DECREASE IN EFFICIENCY DURING YEARS OF DECREASING PRODUCTION. THE ANALYSIS CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE TWO METHODS DO NOT SHOW THE SAME DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT AND SHOULD BE PRESENTED AS SUCH. 2015, SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA DORDRECHT.",NA,NA,"ABEELEN, C.; RIJKSDIENST VOOR ONDERNEMEND NEDERLAND, CROESELAAN 15, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: CHRISTIAAN.ABEELEN@RVO.NL","ARTICLE","10.1007/s12053-015-9398-3",NA,NA,"1570646X","ENERGY EFFICIENCY","ENGLISH",9,"3",NA,"755-770","SPRINGER NETHERLANDS",NA,"SCOPUS","COUNTING PROJECT SAVINGSAN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO MONITOR THE RESULTS OF A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT ON INDUSTRIAL ENERGY SAVINGS","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84944710953&doi=10.1007%2fs12053-015-9398-3&partnerID=40&md5=58556e3511f3d88fa17bbd2795e4e7d3","9",2016,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"ABEELEN C, 2016, ENERGY EFFIC","ABEELEN C, 2016, ENERGY EFFIC"

UPON MOBILIZATION, THIS OC IS EITHER RETURNED TO THE ATMOSPHERE AS CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) OR TRANSPORTED AND ULTIMATELY LOCKED INTO (MARINE) SEDIMENTS, WHERE IT WILL ACT AS A LONG-TERM SINK OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2. THESE FLUXES OF SOIL OC ARE, HOWEVER, DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE, MOSTLY DUE TO THE LACK OF A SOIL-SPECIFIC TRACER. IN THIS STUDY, A SUITE OF BRANCHED GLYCEROL DIALKYL GLYCEROL TETRAETHERS (BRGDGTS), WHICH ARE MEMBRANE LIPIDS OF SOIL BACTERIA, IS TESTED AS SPECIFIC TRACERS FOR SOIL OC FROM SOURCE (SOILS UNDER ARABLE LAND, LEY, GRASSLAND, AND WOODLAND) TO SINK (LOE POOL SEDIMENTS) IN A SMALL CATCHMENT LOCATED IN SOUTHWEST ENGLAND (I.E. CARMINOWE CREEK DRAINING INTO LOE POOL). THE ANALYSIS OF BRGDGTS IN CATCHMENT SOILS REVEALS THAT THEIR DISTRIBUTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ACROSS DIFFERENT LAND USE TYPES (P > 0:05) AND THUS DOES NOT ALLOW LAND-USE-SPECIFIC SOIL CONTRIBUTIONS TO LOE POOL SEDIMENTS TO BE TRACED. FURTHERMORE, THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CONTRIBUTION OF 6-METHYL BRGDGT ISOMERS IN CREEK SEDIMENTS (ISOMERIZATION RATIO (IR) D 0:48 0:10, MEAN STANDARD DEVIATION (SD); P < 0:05) COMPARED TO THAT IN CATCHMENT SOILS (IR D 0:280:11) INDICATES THAT THE INITIAL SOIL SIGNAL IS SUBSTANTIALLY ALTERED BY BRGDGT PRODUCED IN SITU. SIMILARLY, THE RIVERINE BRGDGT SIGNAL APPEARS TO BE OVERWRITTEN BY LACUSTRINE BRGDGTS IN THE LAKE SEDIMENTARY RECORD, INDICATED BY REMARKABLY LOWER METHYLATION OF BRANCHED TETRAETHERS (MBT05ME D 0:46 0:02 IN CREEK BED SEDIMENTS AND 0:38 0:01 IN LAKE CORE SEDIMENTS; P < 0:05) AND A HIGHER DEGREE OF CYCLIZATION (DC D 0:230:02 IN CREEK BED SEDIMENTS AND 0:320:08 IN LAKE CORE SEDIMENTS). THUS, IN THIS SMALL CATCHMENT, BRGDGTS DO NOT ALLOW US TO TRACE SOIL OC TRANSPORT. NEVERTHELESS, THE DOWNCORE CHANGES IN THE DEGREE OF CYCLIZATION AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ISOPRENOID GDGTS PRODUCED BY METHANOGENS IN THE LOE POOL SEDIMENT DO REFLECT LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OVER THE PAST 100 YEARS AND HAVE RECORDED THE EUTROPHICATION HISTORY OF THE LAKE. 2020 AUTHOR(S).",NA,NA,"GUO, J.; DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: J.GUO@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.5194/bg-17-3183-2020",NA,NA,"17264170","BIOGEOSCIENCES","ENGLISH",5,"12",NA,"3183-3201","COPERNICUS GMBH",NA,"SCOPUS","ASSESSING BRANCHED TETRAETHER LIPIDS AS TRACERS OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON TRANSPORT THROUGH THE CARMINOWE CREEK CATCHMENT (SOUTHWEST ENGLAND)","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087391988&doi=10.5194%2fbg-17-3183-2020&partnerID=40&md5=4f42e4c1c01a7a53f81336b188fe7232","17",2020,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;JAMES HUTTON INSTITUTE;UNIVERSITY OF LIGE","NOTREPORTED;DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES;NOTREPORTED",NA,"GUO J, 2020, BIOGEOSCIENCES","GUO J, 2020, BIOGEOSCIENCES"

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD, 92ND ANNUAL MEETING, WASHINGTON, D","TRANSP. REV.","THE NUMBER OF CITIES OFFERING BIKESHARE HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY, FROM JUST A HANDFUL IN THE LATE 1990S TO OVER 800 CURRENTLY. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A REVIEW OF RECENT BIKESHARE LITERATURE. SEVERAL THEMES HAVE BEGUN TO EMERGE FROM STUDIES EXAMINING BIKESHARE. CONVENIENCE IS THE MAJOR MOTIVATOR FOR BIKESHARE USE. FINANCIAL SAVINGS HAS BEEN FOUND TO MOTIVATE THOSE ON A LOW INCOME AND THE DISTANCE ONE LIVES FROM A DOCKING STATION IS AN IMPORTANT PREDICTOR FOR BIKESHARE MEMBERSHIP. IN A RANGE OF COUNTRIES, IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT JUST UNDER 50% OF BIKESHARE MEMBERS USE THE SYSTEM LESS THAN ONCE A MONTH. MEN USE BIKESHARE MORE THAN WOMEN, BUT THE IMBALANCE IS NOT AS DRAMATIC AS PRIVATE BIKE RIDING (AT LEAST IN LOW CYCLING COUNTRIES). COMMUTING IS THE MOST COMMON TRIP PURPOSE FOR ANNUAL MEMBERS. USERS ARE LESS LIKELY THAN PRIVATE CYCLISTS TO WEAR HELMETS, BUT IN COUNTRIES WITH MANDATORY HELMET LEGISLATION, USAGE LEVELS HAVE SUFFERED. BIKESHARE USERS APPEAR LESS LIKELY TO BE INJURED THAN PRIVATE BIKE RIDERS. FUTURE DIRECTIONS INCLUDE INTEGRATION WITH E-BIKES, GPS (GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM), DOCKLESS SYSTEMS AND IMPROVED PUBLIC TRANSPORT INTEGRATION. GREATER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACTS OF BIKESHARE, IN TERMS OF MODE CHOICE, EMISSIONS, CONGESTION AND HEALTH. 2015 TAYLOR & FRANCIS.",NA,NA,"FISHMAN, E.; DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL PLANNING, HEIDELBERGLAAN 2, 3584 CS UTRECHT, PO BOX 80115, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: INFO@SENSIBLETRANSPORT.ORG.AU","ARTICLE","10.1080/01441647.2015.1033036",NA,NA,"01441647","TRANSPORT REVIEWS","ENGLISH",365,"1",NA,"92-113","ROUTLEDGE",NA,"SCOPUS","BIKESHARE: A REVIEW OF RECENT LITERATURE","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952299341&doi=10.1080%2f01441647.2015.1033036&partnerID=40&md5=98282c48515b309164b84e4136404c24","36",2016,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"FISHMAN E, 2016, TRANSP REV","FISHMAN E, 2016, TRANSP REV"

CONFOCAL FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY REVEALS THAT RETRO-ALDOLIZATION OF GLUCOSE IN CH3OH AT 160 C IS ACCOMPANIED WITH THE BUILD-UP OF INSOLUBLE OLIGOMERIC DEPOSITS IN THE MICROPORES, RESULTING IN A RAPID CATALYST DEACTIVATION. THESE DEPOSITS ACCUMULATE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE OUTER REGIONS OF THE ZEOLITE CRYSTALS, WHICH POINTS TO MASS TRANSPORT LIMITATIONS. GLUCOSE ISOMERIZATION IN WATER IS NOT ONLY ACCOMPANIED BY THE FORMATION OF INSOLUBLE DEPOSITS IN THE MICROPORES, BUT ALSO BY THE STRUCTURAL DEGRADATION OF THE ZEOLITE DUE TO DESILICATION AND DESTANNATION.

EPIGENETIC.","THE WATER FLEA DAPHNIA MAGNA IS A KEYSTONE SPECIES IN FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS AND HAS BEEN WIDELY USED AS A MODEL ORGANISM IN ENVIRONMENTAL ECOTOXICOLOGY. THIS AQUATIC CRUSTACEAN IS SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS AND DISPLAYS CONSIDERABLE PLASTICITY IN ADAPTING TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. PART OF THIS PLASTICITY MAY BE DUE TO EPIGENETIC REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION, INCLUDING CHANGES TO DNA METHYLATION AND HISTONE MODIFICATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE GENERALLY HYPOMETHYLATED GENOME OF THIS SPECIES, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE HISTONE CODE MAY HAVE AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE EPIGENETIC CONTROL AND THAT HISTONE MODIFICATIONS MIGHT BE AN EARLY MARKER FOR STRESS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO CHARACTERIZE THE EPIGENETIC, TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND PHENOTYPIC RESPONSES AND THEIR CAUSAL LINKAGES IN DIRECTLY EXPOSED ADULT (F0) DAPHNIA AND PERITONEAL EXPOSED NEONATES (F1) AFTER A CHRONIC (7-DAY) EXPOSURE TO A SUBLETHAL CONCENTRATION (10 MG/L) OF 5-AZACYTIDINE, A WELL-STUDIED VERTEBRATE DNA METHYLATION INHIBITOR. EXPOSURE OF THE F0 GENERATION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE CUMULATIVE FECUNDITY, ACCOMPANIED WITH DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF GENES IN THE ONE-CARBON-CYCLE METABOLIC PATHWAY. IN THE EPIGENOME OF THE F0 GENERATION, A DECREASE IN GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION, BUT NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ON H3K4ME3 OR H3K27ME3, WERE OBSERVED. IN THE F1 OFFSPRING GENERATION, CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION, A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION AND CHANGES IN HISTONE MODIFICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT EXPOSURE DURING ADULTHOOD MAY RESULT IN MORE PRONOUNCED EFFECTS ON EARLY DEVELOPMENT IN THE OFFSPRING GENERATION, THOUGH INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA SHOULD BE CAREFULLY DONE SINCE BOTH THE EXPOSURE REGIME AND DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD IS DIFFERENT IN THE TWO GENERATIONS EXAMINED. THE OBTAINED RESULTS IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CRUSTACEAN EPIGENETICS AND THE TOOLS DEVELOPED MAY PROMOTE USE OF EPIGENETIC MARKERS IN HAZARD ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S).

RES. LIBR.","THE MANGROVE BELT ALONG THE COAST OF THE THREE GUIANAS, SOUTH AMERICA, FORMS A UNIQUE ECOSYSTEM AND ACTS EFFICIENTLY AS A NATURAL SOFT COASTAL DEFENCE STRUCTURE. THE GENERAL MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN STUDIED FOR OVER FOUR DECADES AND THE PROCESSES GOVERNING THE COASTAL MORPHODYNAMICS ARE NOW UNDERSTOOD, AT LEAST QUALITATIVELY. THEY CONSIST OF AN INTERACTION BETWEEN MANGROVES, HYDRODYNAMICS AND SEDIMENT MECHANICS. TWENTY PERCENT OF THE MUD DISCHARGED BY THE AMAZON IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IS TRANSPORTED TO THE WEST ALONG THE COAST BY WAVES AND CURRENTS IN DISCRETE MUD BANKS OF A FEW 10S OF KM LENGTH, WHICH TRAVEL AT A SPEED OF THE ORDER OF 2KM/YEAR. DURING THE PRESENCE OF A MUD BANK WAVES ARE DAMPED, MUD IS TRAPPED AND COLONIZED BY MANGROVES. ONCE A MUD BANK HAS PASSED, THE WAVES CAN ATTACK THE SHORE AGAIN. THIS RESULTS IN A CYCLE OF LAND ACCRETION AND EROSION, WITH AN AVERAGE NET GAIN OF 1M COAST PER CYCLE OF ROUGHLY 30YEARS. HOWEVER, IN LOCATIONS WHERE TOO MANY MANGROVES HAVE BEEN REMOVED, THE COAST HAS LOST ITS NATURAL RESILIENCE AND THE SETTLEMENTS AND FIELDS ARE PRONE TO FLOODING, A CONCERN THAT INCREASES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND PREDICTED SEA-LEVEL RISE (SLR). HARD COASTAL DEFENCE STRUCTURES, SUCH AS THOSE IN GUYANA, ARE EXPENSIVE AND NOT SUSTAINABLE. BASED ON MANY LESSONS LEARNT, PILOT PROJECTS ON MANGROVE REHABILITATION HAVE STARTED. AT THE SAME TIME RESEARCH EFFORTS ARE UNDERTAKEN TO ALLOW MAKING QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL RISKS FOR THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, NUMERICAL PREDICTION MODELS ARE DEVELOPED WHICH CAN COMPUTE CURRENTS, WAVE ACTION AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT ALONG THE COAST OF THE GUIANAS. DIFFERENT CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS CAN BE INVESTIGATED. THESE MODELS CAN SERVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS DECISION SUPPORT TOOL FOR THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COASTAL ZONE.

THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THIS GAP BY APPLYING A DECISION ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE TO IDENTIFY WHAT KIND OF MEAN SEA LEVEL RISE (SLR) INFORMATION IS NEEDED FOR LOCAL COASTAL ADAPTATION DECISIONS. WE FIRST CHARACTERIZE THESE DECISIONS, THEN IDENTIFY SUITABLE DECISION ANALYSIS APPROACHES AND THE SEA LEVEL INFORMATION REQUIRED, AND FINALLY DISCUSS IF AND HOW THESE INFORMATION NEEDS CAN BE MET GIVEN THE STATE OF THE ART OF SEA LEVEL SCIENCE. WE FIND THAT FOUR TYPES OF INFORMATION ARE NEEDED: (I) PROBABILISTIC PREDICTIONS FOR SHORT-TERM DECISIONS WHEN USERS ARE UNCERTAINTY TOLERANT; (II) HIGH-END AND LOW-END SLR SCENARIOS CHOSEN FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY TOLERANCE; (III) UPPER BOUNDS OF SLR FOR USERS WITH A LOW UNCERTAINTY TOLERANCE; AND (IV) LEARNING SCENARIOS DERIVED FROM ESTIMATING WHAT KNOWLEDGE WILL PLAUSIBLY EMERGE ABOUT SLR OVER TIME. PROBABILISTIC PREDICTIONS CAN ONLY BE ATTAINED FOR THE NEAR TERM (I.E., 20302050) BEFORE SLR SIGNIFICANTLY DIVERGES BETWEEN LOW AND HIGH EMISSION SCENARIOS, FOR LOCATIONS FOR WHICH MODES OF CLIMATE VARIABILITY ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD AND THE VERTICAL LAND MOVEMENT CONTRIBUTION TO LOCAL SEA LEVELS IS SMALL. MEANINGFUL SLR UPPER BOUNDS CANNOT BE DEFINED UNAMBIGUOUSLY FROM A PHYSICAL PERSPECTIVE. LOW- TO HIGH-END SCENARIOS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY TOLERANCE AND LEARNING SCENARIOS CAN BE PRODUCED, BUT THIS INVOLVES BOTH EXPERT AND USER JUDGMENTS. THE DECISION ANALYSIS PROCEDURE ELABORATED HERE CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER TYPES OF CLIMATE INFORMATION THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION PURPOSES. 2019.

A POPULATION-BASED DUTCH COHORT STUDY, THE OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COHORT STUDY (AMIGO) (N = 14,829; AGES 31-65 YEARS), WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2011/2012 (T0), WITH FOLLOW-UP OF A SUBGROUP (N = 3,992 INVITED) IN 2013 (T1; N = 2,228) AND 2014 (T2; N = 1,740). WE MODELED FAR-FIELD RF-EMF EXPOSURE FROM MOBILE-PHONE BASE STATIONS AT THE HOME ADDRESSES OF THE PARTICIPANTS USING A 3-DIMENSIONAL GEOSPATIAL MODEL (NISMAP). PERCEIVED EXPOSURE (0 = NOT AT ALL; 6 = VERY MUCH), NONSPECIFIC SYMPTOMS, AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES WERE ASSESSED BY QUESTIONNAIRE. WE PERFORMED CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING FIXED-EFFECTS REGRESSION. WE FOUND SMALL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN MODELED AND PERCEIVED EXPOSURE IN AMIGO PARTICIPANTS AT BASELINE (N = 14,309; RSPEARMAN = 0.10). FOR 222 FOLLOW-UP PARTICIPANTS, MODELED EXPOSURE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY (>0.030 MW/M2) BETWEEN T0 AND T1. THIS INCREASE IN MODELED EXPOSURE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN PERCEIVED EXPOSURE DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD. IN CONTRAST TO MODELED RF-EMF EXPOSURE FROM MOBILE-PHONE BASE STATIONS, PERCEIVED EXPOSURE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SYMPTOM REPORTING SCORES IN BOTH CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL ANALYSES, AS WELL AS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES. 2017 THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,"AJEPA","MARTENS, A.L.; INSTITUTE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT SCIENCES, YALELAAN 2, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: A.L.MARTENS@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1093/aje/kwx041",NA,NA,"00029262","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY","ENGLISH",18,"2",NA,"210-219","OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS","28398549","SCOPUS","MODELED AND PERCEIVED EXPOSURE TO RADIOFREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS FROM MOBILE-PHONE BASE STATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SYMPTOMS OVER TIME IN A GENERAL POPULATION COHORT","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029667643&doi=10.1093%2faje%2fkwx041&partnerID=40&md5=778765a4171bb63da9ee4f1656ba7f62","186",2017,"UNIVERSITEIT UTRECHT;VU UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER;VU UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER;NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT;IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON;UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER UTRECHT;SCHIPHOL","NOTREPORTED;INSTITUTE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT SCIENCES;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MARTENS AL, 2017, AM J EPIDEMIOL","MARTENS AL, 2017, AM J EPIDEMIOL"

GEOSCI.","THE TRANSPORT OF FLUIDS THROUGH THE EARTH'S CRUST CONTROLS THE REDISTRIBUTION OF ELEMENTS TO FORM MINERAL AND HYDROCARBON DEPOSITS, THE RELEASE AND SEQUESTRATION OF GREENHOUSE GASES, AND FACILITATES METAMORPHIC REACTIONS THAT INFLUENCE LITHOSPHERIC RHEOLOGY. IN PERMEABLE SYSTEMS WITH A WELL-CONNECTED POROSITY, FLUID TRANSPORT IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY FLUID PRESSURE GRADIENTS. IN LESS PERMEABLE ROCKS, DEFORMATION MAY INDUCE PERMEABILITY BY CREATING INTERCONNECTED HETEROGENEITIES, BUT WITHOUT THESE PERTURBATIONS, MASS TRANSPORT IS LIMITED ALONG GRAIN BOUNDARIES OR RELIES ON TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES THAT SELF-GENERATE TRANSIENT FLUID PATHWAYS. THE LATTER CAN FACILITATE LARGE-SCALE FLUID AND MASS TRANSPORT IN NOMINALLY IMPERMEABLE ROCKS WITHOUT LARGE-SCALE FLUID TRANSPORT PATHWAYS. HERE, WE SHOW THAT PERVASIVE, FLUID-DRIVEN METAMORPHISM OF CRUSTAL IGNEOUS ROCKS IS DIRECTLY COUPLED TO THE PRODUCTION OF NANOSCALE POROSITY. USING MULTI-DIMENSIONAL NANO-IMAGING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT IN FELDSPAR, THE MOST ABUNDANT MINERAL FAMILY IN THE EARTH'S CRUST, ELECTROKINETIC TRANSPORT THROUGH REACTION-INDUCED NANOPORES (<100 NM) CAN POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT.

IN ADDITION, THEY ACT AS MAJOR CONDUITS OF ORGANIC MATTER FROM THE SHALLOW PRODUCTIVE SHELF TO THE FOOD DEPRIVED DEEP-SEA, PROMOTING GRADIENTS IN FOOD RESOURCES AND AREAS OF SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION AND DEPOSITION. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE BALTIMORE AND NORFOLK CANYONS, IN THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN, AND INVESTIGATES HOW DIFFERENT BIOGEOCHEMICAL DRIVERS INFLUENCE CANYON AND SLOPE MACROFAUNAL COMMUNITIES. REPLICATED SEDIMENT CORES WERE COLLECTED ALONG THE MAIN AXES (~1801200 M) OF BALTIMORE AND NORFOLK CANYONS AND AT COMPARABLE DEPTHS ON THE ADJACENT SLOPES. CORES WERE SORTED, ASSESSING WHOLE COMMUNITY MACROFAUNAL (>300 M) ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY AND STANDING STOCKS. CANYON COMMUNITIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM SLOPE COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE PATTERNS AND COMMUNITY ASSEMBLAGES, WHICH WERE ATTRIBUTED TO HIGH LEVELS OF ORGANIC MATTER ENRICHMENT WITHIN CANYONS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM THE EXPECTED DENSITY-DEPTH RELATIONSHIP IN BOTH CANYONS, DRIVEN BY ENHANCED ABUNDANCES BETWEEN 800 AND 900 M CANYON DEPTHS, WHICH WAS CHARACTERISED AS A DEPOSITION ZONE FOR ORGANIC MATTER. BATHYMETRIC ZONATION, SEDIMENT DYNAMICS, ORGANIC ENRICHMENT, AND DISTURBANCE EVENTS WERE CLEAR FACTORS THAT STRUCTURED THE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES IN BOTH BALTIMORE AND NORFOLK CANYONS.

OUR THEORETICAL BASIS FOR EXPLAINING FLOOD PREPAREDNESS DECISIONS IS PROTECTION MOTIVATION THEORY, WHICH WE EXTEND USING A VARIETY OF OTHER VARIABLES THAT CAN HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON INDIVIDUAL DECISION MAKING UNDER RISK, SUCH AS RISK ATTITUDES, TIME PREFERENCES, SOCIAL NORMS, TRUST, AND LOCAL FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES. OUR RESULTS IN RELATION TO OUR MAIN HYPOTHESIS ARE AS FOLLOWS. INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN HIGH FLOOD RISK ZONES TAKE MORE FLOOD-PROOFING MEASURES IN THEIR HOME THAN INDIVIDUALS IN LOW-RISK ZONES, WHICH SUGGESTS THE FORMER GROUP HAS A HIGH THREAT APPRAISAL. WITH REGARD TO COPING APPRAISAL VARIABLES, WE FIND THAT A HIGH RESPONSE EFFICACY AND A HIGH SELF-EFFICACY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN TAKING FLOOD DAMAGE MITIGATION MEASURES, WHILE PERCEIVED RESPONSE COST DOES NOT. IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS TO FLOOD-PROOF HOMES, SUCH AS RISK ATTITUDES, TIME PREFERENCES, AND PRIVATE VALUES OF BEING WELL PREPARED FOR FLOODING. INVESTMENTS IN ELEVATING ONE'S HOME ARE MAINLY INFLUENCED BY BUILDING CODE REGULATIONS AND ARE NEGATIVELY RELATED WITH EXPECTATIONS OF RECEIVING FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF. WE DISCUSS A VARIETY OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE INDIVIDUAL FLOOD PREPAREDNESS DECISIONS, INCLUDING INCENTIVES FOR RISK REDUCTION THROUGH FLOOD INSURANCE, AND COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGNS FOCUSED ON COPING APPRAISALS AND INFORMING PEOPLE ABOUT FLOOD RISK THEY FACE OVER LONG TIME HORIZONS. 2019 THE AUTHORS.

PRACT. RES.","URBAN PHYSICAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS A FRONTLINE DEFENSE MECHANISM TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE CLIMATE-RELATED IMPACTS. MARKET INSTRUMENTS ARE OFTEN CITED AS POSSIBLE MEANS TO SPREAD RISK AND REDUCE FINANCIAL BURDENS ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT EXISTING RESEARCH TENDS TO FOCUS ON THE TECHNICAL ISSUES OF INSTRUMENTS AND NEGLECTS CONSIDERING INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS THAT MAY ENABLE OR CONSTRAIN LOCAL MARKET-BASED FINANCING MECHANISMS. IN THIS ARTICLE, THREE CORE DILEMMAS (VALUES UNCERTAINTY, PLANNING HORIZON, AND INDIRECT BENEFITS) ARE USED TO ANALYZE THE RESPONSES OF PRACTITIONERS TO A POSSIBLE FINANCING INSTRUMENT. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE PRACTITIONERS RESPONSES TO TAX INCREMENT FINANCING WERE LARGELY SHAPED BY THE ADAPTATION DILEMMAS AND NOT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSTRUMENT PER SE. BY MAPPING THE DILEMMAS ONTO WHETHER THEY WOULD RECOMMEND IT, PARTICIPANTS IMPOSED A FINANCIAL BARRIER ON CLIMATE ADAPTATION INVESTMENTS. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT A KEY IMPERATIVE IN THE DESIGN OF POLICY INSTRUMENTS IS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE CONGRUENCY OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS AT THE STREET LEVEL IN ORDER TO BE IN-STEP WITH THE CURRENT SOCIOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS. THE FINDINGS ALSO POINT TO FOUR KEY ATTRIBUTES THAT A LOCAL MARKET-BASED INSTRUMENT WOULD NEED TO BE ALIGNED AND RESPONSIVE TO THE DUTCH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT. 2016 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP.",NA,NA,"ROOT, L.; GEOGRAHPY, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: E.ROOT@FM.RU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1080/02697459.2016.1158073",NA,NA,"02697459","PLANNING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH","ENGLISH",3,"3",NA,"250-269","ROUTLEDGE",NA,"SCOPUS","TEST DRIVING A FINANCING INSTRUMENT FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION: ANALYZING INSTITUTIONAL DILEMMAS USING SIMULATION GAMING","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961392934&doi=10.1080%2f02697459.2016.1158073&partnerID=40&md5=0becc11569d8b5754a5c95a009cb5131","31",2016,"RADBOUD UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF UTRECHT","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"ROOT L, 2016, PLANN PRACT RES","ROOT L, 2016, PLANN PRACT RES"

SUCH SCENARIOS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS (GEAS). CURRENTLY, HOWEVER, SCENARIOS IN GEAS ARE MOSTLY DEVELOPED AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL BY EXPERTS AND RESEARCHERS, AND LOCALLY IMAGINED, BOTTOM-UP SCENARIOS DO NOT PLAY A ROLE IN SUCH ASSESSMENTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ARGUE THAT ADDRESSING FUTURE SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES FOR ACHIEVING MORE EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT IN GEAS REQUIRES A MORE EXPLICIT ROLE FOR BOTTOM-UP INSPIRED FUTURES. TO THIS END, THIS PAPER EMPLOYS AN INNOVATIVE GLOBAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE FUTURES THAT ARE GROUNDED IN LOCAL REALITIES AND EXISTING PRACTICAL ACTIONS, AND THAT CAN BE APPROPRIATELY SCALED TO THE REQUIRED DECISION-MAKING LEVEL. THIS FRAMEWORK WAS APPLIED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UNS GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK 6, A MAJOR EXAMPLE OF A GEA. WE DEVELOPED NOVEL METHODS FOR SYNTHESIZING INSIGHTS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF LOCAL PRACTICES AND PERSPECTIVES INTO GLOBAL FUTURES. WE COLLECTED INFORMATION FROM CROWDSOURCING PLATFORMS, OUTCOMES OF PARTICIPATORY WORKSHOPS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE WORLD, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF REPORTED REGIONAL OUTLOOKS. WE ANALYSED THESE ACCORDING TO A FRAMEWORK ALSO USED BY AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODEL IN THE SAME GEA. WE CONCLUDE THAT BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS TRANSFORMATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT ENVISION FUTURE PATHWAYS TOWARDS GREATER SUSTAINABILITY SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN CURRENT GEA SCENARIO-DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES. THEY PROVIDE DECISION MAKERS WITH REQUIRED ACTIONABLE INFORMATION BASED ON TANGIBLE SYNERGISTIC SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED ON THE GROUND. THIS WORK HAS REVEALED THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE INTEGRATION OF BOTTOM-UP KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHTS INTO GEAS, TO MAKE SUCH ASSESSMENTS MORE SALIENT AND VALUABLE TO DECISION MAKERS. 2021, THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,NA,"PEREIRA, L.; CENTRE FOR SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS, SOUTH AFRICA; EMAIL: PEREIRA.LAURA18@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1007/s11625-021-01013-x",NA,NA,"18624065","SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE","ENGLISH",0,NA,NA,NA,"SPRINGER JAPAN",NA,"SCOPUS","GROUNDING GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS THROUGH BOTTOM-UP FUTURES BASED ON LOCAL PRACTICES AND PERSPECTIVES","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112457699&doi=10.1007%2fs11625-021-01013-x&partnerID=40&md5=d87cf7917708e42b2e1fb714126575ef",NA,2021,"STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF THE WITWATERSRAND;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;STOCKHOLM RESILIENCE CENTRE;UNIVERSITIES SPACE RESEARCH ASSOCIATION;NEW SCHOOL;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA-CHAPEL HILL;TECHNISCHEN UNIVERSITT BERLIN;UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME;NELSON MANDELA UNIVERSITY;STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA","NOTREPORTED;CENTRE FOR SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS;NOTREPORTED",NA,"PEREIRA L, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY SCI","PEREIRA L, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY SCI"

GEOCHRONOL.","LACUSTRINE FILLS, INCLUDING THOSE OF OXBOW LAKES IN RIVER FLOODPLAINS, OFTEN HOLD VALUABLE SEDIMENTARY AND BIOLOGICAL PROXY RECORDS OF PALAEO-ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. PRECISE DATING OF ACCUMULATED SEDIMENTS AT LEVELS THROUGHOUT THESE RECORDS IS CRUCIAL FOR INTERPRETATION AND CORRELATION OF (PROXY) DATA EXISTING WITHIN THE FILLS. TYPICALLY, DATES ARE GATHERED FROM MULTIPLE SAMPLED LEVELS AND THEIR RESULTS ARE COMBINED IN AGE-DEPTH MODELS TO ESTIMATE THE AGES OF EVENTS IDENTIFIED BETWEEN THE DATINGS. IN THIS PAPER, A METHOD OF AGE-DEPTH MODELLING IS PRESENTED THAT VARIES THE VERTICAL ACCUMULATION RATE OF THE LAKE FILL BASED ON CONTINUOUS SEDIMENTARY DATA. IN BETWEEN BAYESIAN CALIBRATED RADIOCARBON DATES, THIS PRODUCES A MODIFIED NON-LINEAR AGE-DEPTH RELATION BASED ON SEDIMENTOLOGY RATHER THAN LINEAR OR SPLINE INTERPOLATION.THE METHOD IS SHOWCASED ON A CORE OF AN INFILLED PALAEOMEANDER AT THE FLOODPLAIN EDGE OF THE RIVER RHINE NEAR RHEINBERG (GERMANY). THE SEQUENCE SPANS FROM ~4.7 TO 2.9 KA CAL BP AND CONSISTS OF 5.5 M OF LAMINATED LACUSTRINE, ORGANO-CLASTIC MUD, COVERED BY ~1 M OF PEATY CLAY. FOUR RADIOCARBON DATES PROVIDE DIRECT DATING CONTROL, MAPPING AND DATING IN THE WIDER SURROUNDINGS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONTROL. THE LAMINATED, ORGANO-CLASTIC FACIES OF THE OXBOW FILL CONTAINS A RECORD OF NEARBY FLUVIAL-GEOMORPHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, INCLUDING MEANDER RECONFIGURATION EVENTS AND PASSAGE OF RARE LARGE FLOODS, RECOGNIZED AS FLUCTUATIONS IN COARSENESS AND AMOUNT OF ALLOCHTHONOUS CLASTIC SEDIMENT INPUT. CONTINUOUS ALONG-CORE SAMPLING AND MEASUREMENT OF LOSS-ON-IGNITION (LOI) PROVIDED A FAST WAY OF EXPRESSING THE VARIATION IN CLASTIC SEDIMENTATION INFLUX FROM THE NEARBY RIVER VERSUS AUTOCHTHONOUS ORGANIC DEPOSITION DERIVED FROM BIOGENIC PRODUCTION IN THE LAKE ITSELF. THIS LOW-COST SEDIMENTARY PROXY DATA FEEDS INTO THE AGE-DEPTH MODELLING. THE SEDIMENTOLOGY-MODELLED AGE-DEPTH RELATION (RE)PRODUCES THE DISTINCT LITHOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES IN THE FILL AS MARKED CHANGES IN SEDIMENTATION RATE. ESPECIALLY THE ORGANO-CLASTIC MUDDY FACIES SUBDIVIDES IN CENTENNIAL INTERVALS OF RELATIVE FASTER AND SLOWER ACCUMULATION. FOR SUCH INTERVALS, SEDIMENTATION RATES ARE PRODUCED THAT DEVIATE 10-20% FROM THAT IN SIMPLER STEPPED LINEAR AGE-MODELS. FOR IRREGULARLY LAMINATED MUDDY INTERVALS OF THE OXBOW FILL - FROM WHICH MEANINGFUL SAMPLING FOR RADIOCARBON DATING IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN FROM PEATY OR SLOWLY ACCUMULATING ORGANIC LAKE SEDIMENTS - SUPPLEMENTING SPOTTY RADIOCARBON SAMPLING WITH CONTINUOUS SEDIMENTARY PROXY DATA CREATES MORE REALISTIC AGE-DEPTH MODELLING RESULTS. 2016 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,NA,"MINDERHOUD, P.S.J.P.O.

(2009) REV CHIL HIST NAT, 82, PP. 299-31","SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY WATERSHED SCI.","THE INVASIVE AQUATIC PLANT EGERIA DENSA (BRAZILIAN WATERWEED) IS A SUBMERSED AQUATIC PLANT THAT HAS EXPANDED ITS DISTRIBUTION IN BOTH ITS NATIVE AND INTRODUCED RANGE. BECAUSE THE PLANT GROWS SO DENSELY, IT CAN BECOME A PROBLEM FOR MANAGEMENT OF WATERWAYS AND HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE ONCE ESTABLISHED AND MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL CONTROLS HAVE SHOWN LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS. HERE WE ANALYZE THE DISTRIBUTION OF E. DENSA IN THE SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN DELTA (THE DELTA) OF CALIFORNIA, USA, USING ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES THAT INCLUDE MEAN WATER VELOCITY, MEAN WATER TURBIDITY, AND WATER COLUMN DEPTH. WE FOUND THAT INCREASING WATER COLUMN DEPTH STRONGLY LIMITED E. DENSA OCCURRENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN DEPTH AT MEAN LOWER LOW WATER (MLLW) EXCEEDS 2 M. THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE OCCURRED AT LOCATIONS WITH A WATER COLUMN DEPTH OF -1 TO 2 M AT MLLW. TURBIDITY HAD A RELIABLY NEGATIVE EFFECT ON E. DENSA OCCURRENCE; AS WATER CLARITY HAS INCREASED IN THE DELTA, IT HAS LIKELY FAVORED THE SPREAD OF THE PLANT. NEITHER MEAN WATER VELOCITY NOR MAXIMUM WATER VELOCITY HAD A RELIABLE EFFECT ON E. DENSA PROBABILITY, IN SPITE OF SCIENTIFIC AND OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE THAT IT IS SENSITIVE TO FLOWS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST POTENTIALLY SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT EMPHASIZE SHALLOW WATER HABITAT IN THE RANGE FAVORED BY E. DENSA. WITHOUT SOME WAY TO MANAGE SPREAD OF THE PLANT-THROUGH SPRAYING, SEDIMENT LOADING, OR GATING-CHANNELS IN SUCH PROJECTS ARE AT RISK OF BEING TAKEN OVER BY E. DENSA. HOWEVER, THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WATER OUTFLOW IN WATER YEAR 2008 WAS VERY LOW, AND THAT E. DENSA ABUNDANCE MAY BE PARTIALLY CONTROLLED BY HIGHER WATER FLOWS THAN THOSE CONSIDERED HERE. 2016 BY THE ARTICLE AUTHOR(S).","4",NA,NA,"ARTICLE","10.15447/sfews.2016v14iss1art4",NA,NA,"15462366","SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY AND WATERSHED SCIENCE","ENGLISH",14,"1",NA,NA,"ESCHOLARSHIP",NA,"SCOPUS","PHYSICAL CONTROLS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SUBMERSED AQUATIC WEED EGERIA DENSA IN THE SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN DELTA AND IMPLICATIONS FOR HABITAT RESTORATION","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962627578&doi=10.15447%2fsfews.2016v14iss1art4&partnerID=40&md5=c2fc2cd634ce36aea5574f443607e446","14",2016,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS;MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS;UNIVERSITEIT UTRECHT","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS;MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS;UNIVERSITEIT UTRECHT",NA,"DURAND J, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY WATERSHED SCI","DURAND J, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY WATERSHED SCI"

THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASES, INJURIES, AND RISK FACTORS STUDY (GBD) PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT OF PUBLISHED, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, AND CONTRIBUTED DATA ON INCIDENCE, PREVALENCE, AND MORTALITY FOR A MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND COLLECTIVELY EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF DISEASES AND INJURIES. METHODS: GBD ESTIMATES INCIDENCE, PREVALENCE, MORTALITY, YEARS OF LIFE LOST (YLLS), YEARS LIVED WITH DISABILITY (YLDS), AND DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE-YEARS (DALYS) DUE TO 369 DISEASES AND INJURIES, FOR TWO SEXES, AND FOR 204 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES. INPUT DATA WERE EXTRACTED FROM CENSUSES, HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS, CIVIL REGISTRATION AND VITAL STATISTICS, DISEASE REGISTRIES, HEALTH SERVICE USE, AIR POLLUTION MONITORS, SATELLITE IMAGING, DISEASE NOTIFICATIONS, AND OTHER SOURCES. CAUSE-SPECIFIC DEATH RATES AND CAUSE FRACTIONS WERE CALCULATED USING THE CAUSE OF DEATH ENSEMBLE MODEL AND SPATIOTEMPORAL GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION. CAUSE-SPECIFIC DEATHS WERE ADJUSTED TO MATCH THE TOTAL ALL-CAUSE DEATHS CALCULATED AS PART OF THE GBD POPULATION, FERTILITY, AND MORTALITY ESTIMATES. DEATHS WERE MULTIPLIED BY STANDARD LIFE EXPECTANCY AT EACH AGE TO CALCULATE YLLS. A BAYESIAN META-REGRESSION MODELLING TOOL, DISMOD-MR 2.1, WAS USED TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INCIDENCE, PREVALENCE, REMISSION, EXCESS MORTALITY, AND CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY FOR MOST CAUSES. PREVALENCE ESTIMATES WERE MULTIPLIED BY DISABILITY WEIGHTS FOR MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE SEQUELAE OF DISEASES AND INJURIES TO CALCULATE YLDS. WE CONSIDERED RESULTS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC INDEX (SDI), A COMPOSITE INDICATOR OF INCOME PER CAPITA, YEARS OF SCHOOLING, AND FERTILITY RATE IN FEMALES YOUNGER THAN 25 YEARS. UNCERTAINTY INTERVALS (UIS) WERE GENERATED FOR EVERY METRIC USING THE 25TH AND 975TH ORDERED 1000 DRAW VALUES OF THE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION. FINDINGS: GLOBAL HEALTH HAS STEADILY IMPROVED OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS AS MEASURED BY AGE-STANDARDISED DALY RATES. AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT POPULATION GROWTH AND AGEING, THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER OF DALYS HAS REMAINED STABLE. SINCE 2010, THE PACE OF DECLINE IN GLOBAL AGE-STANDARDISED DALY RATES HAS ACCELERATED IN AGE GROUPS YOUNGER THAN 50 YEARS COMPARED WITH THE 19902010 TIME PERIOD, WITH THE GREATEST ANNUALISED RATE OF DECLINE OCCURRING IN THE 09-YEAR AGE GROUP. SIX INFECTIOUS DISEASES WERE AMONG THE TOP TEN CAUSES OF DALYS IN CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN 10 YEARS IN 2019: LOWER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS (RANKED SECOND), DIARRHOEAL DISEASES (THIRD), MALARIA (FIFTH), MENINGITIS (SIXTH), WHOOPING COUGH (NINTH), AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (WHICH, IN THIS AGE GROUP, IS FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY CONGENITAL SYPHILIS; RANKED TENTH). IN ADOLESCENTS AGED 1024 YEARS, THREE INJURY CAUSES WERE AMONG THE TOP CAUSES OF DALYS: ROAD INJURIES (RANKED FIRST), SELF-HARM (THIRD), AND INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE (FIFTH). FIVE OF THE CAUSES THAT WERE IN THE TOP TEN FOR AGES 1024 YEARS WERE ALSO IN THE TOP TEN IN THE 2549-YEAR AGE GROUP: ROAD INJURIES (RANKED FIRST), HIV/AIDS (SECOND), LOW BACK PAIN (FOURTH), HEADACHE DISORDERS (FIFTH), AND DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS (SIXTH). IN 2019, ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE AND STROKE WERE THE TOP-RANKED CAUSES OF DALYS IN BOTH THE 5074-YEAR AND 75-YEARS-AND-OLDER AGE GROUPS. SINCE 1990, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED SHIFT TOWARDS A GREATER PROPORTION OF BURDEN DUE TO YLDS FROM NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND INJURIES. IN 2019, THERE WERE 11 COUNTRIES WHERE NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASE AND INJURY YLDS CONSTITUTED MORE THAN HALF OF ALL DISEASE BURDEN. DECREASES IN AGE-STANDARDISED DALY RATES HAVE ACCELERATED OVER THE PAST DECADE IN COUNTRIES AT THE LOWER END OF THE SDI RANGE, WHILE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE STARTED TO STAGNATE OR EVEN REVERSE IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER SDI. INTERPRETATION: AS DISABILITY BECOMES AN INCREASINGLY LARGE COMPONENT OF DISEASE BURDEN AND A LARGER COMPONENT OF HEALTH EXPENDITURE, GREATER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION STRATEGIES. WITH A RAPIDLY AGEING GLOBAL POPULATION, THE DEMANDS ON HEALTH SERVICES TO DEAL WITH DISABLING OUTCOMES, WHICH INCREASE WITH AGE, WILL REQUIRE POLICY MAKERS TO ANTICIPATE THESE CHANGES. THE MIX OF UNIVERSAL AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY SPECIFIC INFLUENCES ON HEALTH REINFORCES THE NEED FOR REGULAR REPORTING ON POPULATION HEALTH IN DETAIL AND BY UNDERLYING CAUSE TO HELP DECISION MAKERS TO IDENTIFY SUCCESS STORIES OF DISEASE CONTROL TO EMULATE, AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE.

AGRIC. SCI.","FOCUSING ON CATTLE (BOS TAURUS, BOS INDICUS), THE PRESENT PAPER DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF THE BREED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DYNAMIC HISTORY OF LIVESTOCK DOMESTICATION. A BREED CATEGORIZATION IS PROPOSED ON THE BASIS OF HOW THE BREEDS CAME INTO EXISTENCE. THE ONLINE APPENDIX (AVAILABLE AT HTTP://JOURNALS.CAMBRIDGE.ORG/AGS) PRESENTS A SURVEY OF THE CATTLE BREEDS OF THE WORLD CONSISTING OF: (1) A LIST OF BREEDS PER COUNTRY AND THEN SUBDIVIDED ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSED CATEGORIES; (2) A LIST OF BREED NAMES, INCLUDING SYNONYMS AND TRANSLATIONS, ORDERED ACCORDING TO A COMPREHENSIVE BREED CLASSIFICATION; AND (3) AN ALPHABETICAL LIST OF THESE NAMES. THE COMMONLY ACCEPTED PERCEPTIONS OF BREEDS AND HOW THESE ARE INFLUENCED BY THE NOMENCLATURE ARE DESCRIBED. CONSIDERING THE HISTORY OF BREEDS, IT IS ARGUED THAT CONSERVATION OF GENETIC DIVERSITY DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY CONSERVATION OF BREEDS. HOWEVER, BREEDS ARE INSTRUMENTAL FOR THE CONSERVATION OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AS INDEPENDENT GENETIC MANAGEMENT UNITS. THESE CONSIDERATIONS MAY VERY WELL BE EXTRAPOLATED TO OTHER DOMESTIC SPECIES.

HEALTH","THE WORLD IS CURRENTLY WITNESSING ITS LARGEST SURGE OF URBAN GROWTH IN HUMAN HISTORY; A TREND THAT DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS HEALTH IMPACTS OF URBAN LIVING. WHILST TRANSPORT IS INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS URBANISATION WAVE, IT ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON POPULATION HEALTH, WHICH ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY DISTRIBUTED. IN THIS PAPER, WE BRING TOGETHER EXPERTISE IN TRANSPORT ENGINEERING, TRANSPORT AND URBAN PLANNING, RESEARCH AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT, EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT IN AN EXERCISE TO SCOPE AND DISCUSS THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF TRANSPORT IN URBAN AREAS. ADOPTING A CROSS-DISCIPLINARY, CO-PRODUCTION APPROACH, WE EXPLORE THE KEY DRIVING FORCES BEHIND THE CURRENT STATE OF URBAN MOBILITY AND OUTLINE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICES THAT COULD FACILITATE POSITIONING HEALTH AT THE CORE OF TRANSPORT DESIGN, PLANNING AND POLICY. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED IMPACTS OF URBAN TRANSPORT SHOWS THAT MOTOR VEHICLE TRAFFIC IS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT PREMATURE MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY THROUGH MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES, PHYSICAL INACTIVITY AND TRAFFIC-RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES INCLUDING INCREASES IN AIR POLLUTION, NOISE AND TEMPERATURE LEVELS, AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN GREEN SPACE. TRENDS OF RAPID AND CAR-CENTRED URBANISATION, MASS MOTORISATION AND A TENDENCY OF POLICY TO FAVOUR CAR MOBILITY AND UNDERVALUE HEALTH IN THE TRANSPORT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA HAS BOTH LED TO, AND EXACERBATED THE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS OF THE TRANSPORT SYSTEMS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, WE ALSO ARGUE THAT THE BENEFITS OF NEW TRANSPORT SCHEMES ON THE ECONOMY ARE EMPHASISED WHILST THE RANGE AND SEVERITY OF IDENTIFIED HEALTH IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORT ARE OFTEN DOWNPLAYED. WE CONCLUDE THE PAPER BY OUTLINING STAKEHOLDERS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE ADOPTION OF A CROSS-DISCIPLINARY CO-PRODUCTION APPROACH THAT TAKES A HEALTH-AWARE PERSPECTIVE AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE A PARADIGM SHIFT IN TRANSPORT PRACTICES. 2016 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,NA,"KHREIS, H.; INSTITUTE FOR TRANSPORT STUDIES, 34-40 UNIVERSITY ROAD, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: TS12HRK@LEEDS.AC.UK","REVIEW","10.1016/j.jth.2016.07.002",NA,NA,"22141405","JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND HEALTH","ENGLISH",84,"3",NA,"249-267","ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF TRAFFIC-RELATED EXPOSURES IN URBAN AREAS: UNDERSTANDING REAL EFFECTS, UNDERLYING DRIVING FORCES AND CO-PRODUCING FUTURE DIRECTIONS","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978999303&doi=10.1016%2fj.jth.2016.07.002&partnerID=40&md5=e3386102f12b5057f6bd57604d491443","3",2016,"UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS;JOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH;COLE DE TECHNOLOGIE SUPRIEURE;CENTRE FOR RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY (CREAL);UNIVERSITAT POMPEU FABRA (UPF);CIBER EPIDEMIOLOGA Y SALUD PBLICA (CIBERESP);UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;NOTDECLARED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"KHREIS H, 2016, J TRANSP HEALTH","KHREIS H, 2016, J TRANSP HEALTH"

GEOCHRONOL., 8, PP. 41-4","CHEM. GEOL.","ANTHROPOGENIC NUTRIENT INPUT HAS CAUSED A RAPID EXPANSION OF BOTTOM WATER HYPOXIA IN THE BALTIC SEA OVER THE PAST CENTURY. TWO EARLIER INTERVALS OF WIDESPREAD HYPOXIA, COINCIDING WITH THE HOLOCENE THERMAL MAXIMUM (HTMHI; 84 KA BEFORE PRESENT; BP) AND THE MEDIEVAL CLIMATE ANOMALY (MCAHI; ~1200750 YEARS BP), HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM BALTIC SEA SEDIMENTS. HERE WE PRESENT SEDIMENT RECORDS FROM TWO SITES IN THE BALTIC SEA, AND COMPARE THE TRACE METAL (AS, BA, CD, CU, MO, NI, PB, RE, SB, TL, U, V, ZN) ENRICHMENTS DURING ALL THREE HYPOXIC INTERVALS. DISTINCT DIFFERENCES ARE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE INTERVALS AND THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS, HIGHLIGHTING THE MUCH STRONGER PERTURBATION OF TRACE METAL CYCLES DURING THE MODERN HYPOXIC INTERVAL. BOTH MO AND U SHOW A STRONG CORRELATION WITH CORG AND VERY HIGH ABSOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS, INDICATIVE OF FREQUENTLY EUXINIC BOTTOM WATERS DURING HYPOXIC INTERVALS. DURING THE MODERN HYPOXIC INTERVAL (MODERNHI) COMPARATIVELY LESS MO IS SEQUESTERED RELATIVE TO CORG THAN IN EARLIER INTERVALS. THIS SUGGESTS PARTIAL DRAWDOWN OF THE WATER COLUMN MO INVENTORY IN THE MODERN WATER COLUMN DUE TO PERSISTENT EUXINIA AND ONLY PARTIAL REPLENISHMENT OF MO THROUGH NORTH SEA INFLOWS. MOLYBDENUM CONTENTS IN MODERN SEDIMENTS ARE LIKELY ALSO AFFECTED BY THE RECENT SLOWDOWN IN INPUT OF MO IN ASSOCIATION WITH DEPOSITION OF FE AND MN OXIDES. STRONG ENRICHMENTS OF U IN RECENT SEDIMENTS CONFIRM THAT THE MODERNHI IS MORE INTENSE THAN PAST INTERVALS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT U IS A MORE RELIABLE INDICATOR FOR THE INTENSITY OF BOTTOM WATER DEOXYGENATION IN THE BALTIC SEA THAN MO. SEDIMENTARY RE ENRICHMENT COMMENCES UNDER MILDLY REDUCING CONDITIONS, BUT THIS ELEMENT IS NOT FURTHER ENRICHED UNDER MORE REDUCING CONDITIONS. ENRICHMENTS OF V ARE RELATIVELY MINOR FOR THE MCAHI AND MODERNHI POSSIBLY DUE TO STRONG RESERVOIR EFFECTS ON V IN THE WATER COLUMN, INDICATING THAT V IS UNRELIABLE AS AN INDICATOR FOR THE INTENSITY OF BOTTOM WATER HYPOXIA IN THIS SETTING. FURTHERMORE, BA PROFILES ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY POST-DEPOSITIONAL REMOBILIZATION THROUGHOUT THE HOLOCENE. THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORG AND NI, TL AND PARTICULARLY CU SUGGESTS THAT THESE TRACE METALS CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT THE CORG FLUX INTO THE SEDIMENTS. PROFILES OF AS, SB AND CD AND ESPECIALLY PB AND ZN ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY ANTHROPOGENIC POLLUTION. 2018 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,NA,"VAN HELMOND, N.A.G.M.; DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES, PRINCETONLAAN 8A, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: N.VANHELMOND@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.06.028",NA,NA,"00092541","CHEMICAL GEOLOGY","ENGLISH",12,NA,NA,"478-490","ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","HYPOXIA IN THE HOLOCENE BALTIC SEA: COMPARING MODERN VERSUS PAST INTERVALS USING SEDIMENTARY TRACE METALS","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049443217&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemgeo.2018.06.028&partnerID=40&md5=1dff671dda27306ed921cdc977c8e58a","493",2018,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF HELSINKI","NOTREPORTED;DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES;NOTREPORTED",NA,"VAN HELMOND NAGM, 2018, CHEM GEOL","VAN HELMOND NAGM, 2018, CHEM GEOL"

STRATIGR.","A NEWLY LOCATED EXPOSURE OF THE NIVEAU THOMEL, AN ORGANIC-RICH LEVEL AT THE CENOMANIAN-TUR-ONIAN BOUNDARY, PROVIDES A HIGHLY EXPANDED RECORD OF OCEANIC ANOXIC EVENT (OAE) 2, EXCEPT FOR THE LOWER RELATIVELY CONDENSED GLAUCONITE-RICH PART OF THE SECTION. THE NEW LOCALITY, CLOSE TO BARREME IN THE VOCONTIAN BASIN, SE FRANCE, IS DEVELOPED IN DEEP-WATER HEMI-PELAGIC FACIES (SHALES, MARLS, MARLY LIMESTONES, VARIABLY ENRICHED IN ORGANIC MATTER) AND PROVIDES AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF PALAEOCEANOGRAPHIC EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OAE 2. INVESTIGATION OF THE BIOSTRATIGRAPHY (NANNOFOSSILS AND PLANKTONIC FORAMINIFERA), ORGANIC AND INORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY (BULK CARBONATE 18 O, TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON (TOC), BULK ORGANIC, BIOMARKER-SPECIFIC AND CARBONATE 13C, MAJOR AND TRACE ELEMENTS, AND ROCK-EVAL DATA) HAS ALLOWED CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SEDIMENTS IN GREAT DETAIL. THE COMBINED STUDY FURTHER CONSTRAINS THE DETAILED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIO-AND CHEMOSTRATIGRAPHY (PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE DETAILS OF THE WELL-DISPLAYED POSITIVE CARBON-ISOTOPE EXCURSION) FOR THIS INTERVAL. THE SECTION ALSO PROVIDES NEW EVIDENCE, IN THE FORM OF A POSITIVE OXYGEN-ISOTOPE EXCURSION AND AN OFFSET BETWEEN CARBONATE AND ORGANIC-CARBON CARBON-ISOTOPE RECORDS, WHICH CONFIRMS THE IMPORTANCE OF COOLING ACCOMPANIED BY A DROP IN DISSOLVED CO 2 IN NEAR-SURFACE WATERS DURING THE PLENUS COLD EVENT THAT CHARACTERIZED THE EARLY PART OF OAE 2. EVIDENCE FOR INCREASED OXYGENATION OF BOTTOM WATERS, TOGETHER WITH ELEVATED CONCENTRATIONS OF REDOX-SENSITIVE AND CHALCOPHILIC ELEMENTS REGISTERED ELSEWHERE THROUGH THE LEVEL OF THE PLENUS COLD EVENT, MAY BE REFLECTED IN ENHANCED CONCENTRATIONS OF IRON (IN GLAUCONITE) AND NICKEL IN COEVAL STRATA FROM THE CLOT CHEVALIER SECTION. 2018 GEBRDER BORNTRAEGER, STUTTGART, GERMANY.",NA,NA,"GALE, A.S.; SCHOOL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, BURNABY BUILDING, BURNABY ROAD, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: ANDY.EALE@PORT.AC.UK","ARTICLE","10.1127/nos/2018/0445",NA,NA,"00780421","NEWSLETTERS ON STRATIGRAPHY","ENGLISH",19,"1",NA,"97-129","E.

BOTH MG-AND FE-SULFATES HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED, THE FORMER BEING RATHER UNCOMMON ON EARTH. TO WHAT EXTENT CAN A NATURAL ACIDIC RIVER SYSTEM ON EARTH BE A TERRESTRIAL ANALOG FOR EARLY MARS ENVIRONMENTS? COPAHUE VOLCANO (ARGENTINA) HAS AN ACTIVE ACID HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM THAT HAS PRECIPITATED A SUITE OF MINERALS IN ITS HYDROTHERMAL RESERVOIR (SILICA, ANHYDRITE, ALUNITE, JAROSITE). LEAKAGE FROM THIS SUBTERRANEAN SYSTEM THROUGH HOT SPRINGS AND INTO THE CRATER LAKE HAVE FORMED A STRONGLY ACIDIFIED WATERSHED (RO AGRIO), WHICH PRECIPITATES A HOST OF MINERALS DURING COOLING AND DILUTION DOWNSTREAM. A SUITE OF MORE THAN 100 MINERALS HAS BEEN FOUND AND CONDITIONS FOR PRECIPITATION OF THE MAIN PHASES ARE SIMULATED WITH SPECIATION/SATURATION ROUTINES. THE LOWER PART OF THE WATERSHED (LAKE CAVIAHUE AND THE LOWER RO AGRIO) HAVE ABUNDANT DEPOSITS OF FERRICRETE SINCE 2003: HYDROUS FERRIC OXIDES AND SCHWERTMANNITE OCCUR, THEIR PRECIPITATION BEING MEDIATED BY FE-OXIDIZING BACTERIA AND PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESSES. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM, AT GREATER DEGREES OF DILUTION, HYDROUS ALUMINUM OXIDES AND SULFATES FORM AND CREATE 'ALCRETES' LINING THE RIVER BED. THE WATERSHED CARRIES AMONG OTHERS JAROSITE, HEMATITE, ANHYDRITE, GYPSUM AND SILICA MINERALS AND THE ORIGIN OF ALL THESE MINERALS COULD BE MODELED THROUGH COOLING/DILUTION OF THE PRIMARY HOT SPRING FLUIDS. SINGLE EVOLUTION (ACIDIFICATION THROUGH CAPTURE OF VOLCANIC GASES, WATER ROCK INTERACTION TO ACQUIRE THE DISSOLVED CATIONS) THROUGH COOLING OF THE PRIMARY FLUIDS COULD EXPLAIN MOST OF THE FE-BEARING MINERALS, BUT TO PRECIPITATE MG-SULFATES, EVAPORATION AND RENEWED INTERACTION WITH OLIVINE-RICH ROCKS IS NEEDED TO SATURATE SOME COMMON MG-SULFATES (E.G., EPSOMITE). THE SCHWERTMANNITE BEDS FORMED THROUGH PROCESSES INVOLVING FE-OXIDIZING BACTERIA, WHICH MAY BE SIGNIFICANT IF THIS MINERAL WAS COMMON ON MARS IN THE PAST. PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESSES ON MARS ARE COMMONLY DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF PHOTO-OXIDATION OF FE, BUT PHOTO-REDUCTION MAY BE A COMMON PROCESS AS WELL, AS WAS FOUND TO BE THE CASE IN THE RO AGRIO WATERSHED. A MODEL OF WATERS ACIDIFIED BY THE CAPTURE OF S-RICH VOLCANIC GASES THAT HAVE REACTED WITH BASALTIC ROCKS, AND THEN EVAPORATED OR WERE NEUTRALIZED BY HIGHER ALKALINITY SURFACE FLUIDS MAY EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN OF THE SULFATE MINERAL SUITES ON MARS QUITE WELL.

THE CLIMATE AT THAT TIME WAS WARMER THAN TODAY, PRIMARILY DUE TO DIFFERENT ORBITAL CONDITIONS, WITH SMALLER ICE SHEETS AND HIGHER SEA-LEVEL. FIELD EVIDENCE FOR MIS 5E SEA-LEVEL WAS REPORTED FROM THOUSANDS OF SITES, BUT OFTEN PALEO SHORELINES WERE MEASURED WITH LOW-ACCURACY TECHNIQUES AND, IN SOME CASES, THERE ARE CONTRASTING INTERPRETATIONS ABOUT PALEO SEA-LEVEL RECONSTRUCTIONS. FOR THIS REASON, LARGE UNCERTAINTIES STILL SURROUND BOTH THE MAXIMUM SEA-LEVEL ATTAINED AS WELL AS THE PATTERN OF SEA-LEVEL CHANGE THROUGHOUT MIS 5E. SUCH UNCERTAINTIES ARE EXACERBATED BY THE LACK OF A UNIFORM APPROACH TO MEASURING AND INTERPRETING THE GEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF PALEO SEA-LEVELS. IN THIS REVIEW, WE DISCUSS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MIS 5E FIELD OBSERVATIONS, AND WE SET THE BASIS FOR A STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO MIS 5E PALEO SEA-LEVEL RECONSTRUCTIONS, THAT IS ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED IN HOLOCENE SEA-LEVEL RESEARCH. APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD DEFINITIONS AND METHODOLOGIES DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO COMPARE DATA FROM DIFFERENT RESEARCH GROUPS AND DIFFERENT AREAS, IN ORDER TO GAIN DEEPER INSIGHTS INTO MIS 5E SEA-LEVEL CHANGES.

CHANGE","THE IMAGE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODEL WAS USED TO DEVELOP A SET OF SCENARIOS TO EVALUATE THE NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (NDCS) SUBMITTED BY PARTIES UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT. THE SCENARIOS PROJECT EMISSIONS AND ENERGY SYSTEM CHANGES UNDER (I) CURRENT POLICIES, (II) IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NDCS, AND (III) VARIOUS TRAJECTORIES TO A RADIATIVE FORCING LEVEL OF 2.8W/M2 IN 2100, WHICH GIVES A PROBABILITY OF ABOUT TWO THIRDS TO LIMIT WARMING TO BELOW 2C. THE SCENARIOS SHOW THAT A COST-OPTIMAL PATHWAY FROM 2020 ONWARDS TOWARDS 2.8W/M2 LEADS TO A GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION LEVEL OF 38 GIGATONNE CO2 EQUIVALENT (GTCO2EQ) BY 2030, EQUAL TO A REDUCTION OF 20% COMPARED TO THE 2010 LEVEL. THE NDCS ARE PROJECTED TO LEAD TO 2030 EMISSION LEVELS OF 50GTCO2EQ, WHICH IS STILL AN INCREASE COMPARED TO THE 2010 LEVEL. A SCENARIO THAT ACHIEVES THE 2.8W/M2 FORCING LEVEL IN 2100 FROM THE 2030 NDC LEVEL REQUIRES MORE RAPID TRANSITIONS AFTER 2030 TO MEET THE FORCING TARGET. IT SHOWS AN ANNUAL REDUCTION RATE IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF 4.7% BETWEEN 2030 AND 2050, RAPIDLY PHASING OUT UNABATED COAL-FIRED POWER PLANT CAPACITY, MORE RAPID SCALE-UP OF LOW-CARBON ENERGY, AND HIGHER MITIGATION COSTS. A BRIDGE SCENARIO SHOWS THAT ENHANCING THE AMBITION LEVEL OF NDCS BEFORE 2030 ALLOWS FOR A SMOOTHER ENERGY SYSTEM TRANSITION, WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL EMISSION REDUCTION RATES OF 4.5% BETWEEN 2030 AND 2050, AND MORE TIME TO PHASE OUT COAL CAPACITY. 2017, THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,"CLCHD","VAN SOEST, H.L.; COPERNICUS INSTITUTE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, P.O.

WE SHOW THAT SPECIATION AND EXTINCTION RATES NEARLY SIMULTANEOUSLY DECREASED IN THE ENVIRONMENTALLY DYNAMIC PHASE AFTER ECOSYSTEM FORMATION AND STABILIZED AFTER DEEP-WATER CONDITIONS ESTABLISHED IN LAKE OHRID. AS THE LAKE DEEPENS, WE ALSO SEE A SWITCH IN THE MACROEVOLUTIONARY TRADE-OFF, RESULTING IN A TRANSITION FROM A VOLATILE ASSEMBLAGE OF SHORT-LIVED ENDEMIC SPECIES TO A STABLE COMMUNITY OF LONG-LIVED SPECIES.

APPL. GEOPHYS.","SEISMIC INTERFEROMETRY CAN RETRIEVE THE GREEN'S FUNCTION BETWEEN RECEIVERS FROM THE CROSS-CORRELATION AND SUMMATION OF RECORDINGS FROM A BOUNDARY OF SURROUNDING SOURCES. HAVING THE SOURCES ONLY ALONG A BOUNDARY IS SUFFICIENT IF THE MEDIUM IS LOSSLESS. IF THE MEDIUM IS DISSIPATIVE, THE RETRIEVED RESULT USING CROSS-CORRELATION CONTAINS NON-PHYSICAL (GHOST) ARRIVALS. WHEN USING RECEIVERS AT THE SURFACE AND TRANSIENT SOURCES IN THE SUBSURFACE FOR THE RETRIEVAL OF THE REFLECTION RESPONSE IN A DISSIPATIVE MEDIUM, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE RETRIEVED GHOST REFLECTIONS ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE QUALITY FACTOR OF THE SUBSURFACE. THE GHOST REFLECTIONS ARE CAUSED BY INTERNAL REFLECTIONS INSIDE SUBSURFACE LAYERS. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN WITH NUMERICAL EXAMPLES FOR RECORDINGS IN A BOREHOLE FROM A SURFACE SOURCE THAT A GHOST REFLECTION CAN BE DISCRIMINATED FROM PHYSICAL REFLECTIONS AND TIED TO A SPECIFIC SUBSURFACE LAYER. AFTER CONNECTING THE GHOST REFLECTION TO A SPECIFIC LAYER, THE QUALITY FACTOR OF THE MEDIUM ABOVE THIS LAYER AND THE REFLECTION COEFFICIENT AT THE LAYER INTERFACE CAN BE ESTIMATED. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE SHOW HOW THE ABOVE PRINCIPLES CAN BE ADAPTED AND APPLIED FOR SURFACE WAVES. DUE TO INTRINSIC LOSSES IN THE MEDIUM, SURFACE-WAVE GHOST REFLECTIONS ARE RETRIEVED FROM INTERNAL SCATTERING BETWEEN SUBVERTICAL BOUNDARIES. WE DEMONSTRATE THE METHOD ON AN ULTRASONIC DATASET RECORDED ON A SAMPLE COMPOSED OF A PVC BLOCK AND AN ALUMINUM BLOCK. THE ALUMINUM BLOCK HAS A GROOVE PARALLEL TO THE PVC/ALUMINUM INTERFACE. USING A SURFACE-WAVE GHOST REFLECTION BETWEEN THE GROOVE AND THE PVC/ALUMINUM INTERFACE, WE ESTIMATE THE QUALITY FACTOR OF THE PVC AND THE REFLECTION COEFFICIENT AT THE PVC/ALUMINUM INTERFACE. WE ALSO SHOW THAT THE GHOST REFLECTION CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND TIED TO THE LAYER BETWEEN THE GROOVE AND THE PVC/ALUMINUM INTERFACE, THUS CONFIRMING PREVIOUS NUMERICAL FINDINGS. 2014 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,NA,"DRAGANOV, D.; DEPARTMENT OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, STEVINWEG 1, NETHERLANDS","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.jappgeo.2014.11.019",NA,NA,"09269851","JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS","ENGLISH",2,NA,NA,"206-214","ELSEVIER",NA,"SCOPUS","QUALITY-FACTOR AND REFLECTION-COEFFICIENT ESTIMATION USING SURFACE-WAVE GHOST REFLECTIONS FROM SUBVERTICAL STRUCTURES","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84917709300&doi=10.1016%2fj.jappgeo.2014.11.019&partnerID=40&md5=b1155052e707148facdd71ff1860df55","112",2015,"DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;THE UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND;DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","NOTREPORTED;DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY",NA,"DRAGANOV D, 2015, J APPL GEOPHYS","DRAGANOV D, 2015, J APPL GEOPHYS"

THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE KEY ELEMENTS AND PROCESSES OF THE MICROBIAL SHALLOW GAS SYSTEM IN THE PLIO-PLEISTOCENE DUTCH SOUTHERN NORTH SEA DELTA BASED ON RECENT FINDINGS FROM DIFFERENT PROJECTS. GEOCHEMICAL AND CARBON ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF SHALLOW GAS OCCURRENCES IN THE DELTA ARE INDICATIVE OF A MICROBIAL ORIGIN OF THE GAS. SHALLOW GAS MAINLY OCCURS IN STRATIGRAPHIC TRAPS AND STACKED ANTICLINAL STRUCTURES ABOVE SALT STRUCTURES, AS INDICATED BY IDENTIFIED DIRECT HYDROCARBON INDICATORS ON SEISMIC, SUCH AS BRIGHT SPOTS. ORGANIC MATTER IN THE DELTA DEPOSITS IS OF PREDOMINANTLY LAND PLANT ORIGIN WITH TOC VALUES VARYING BETWEEN &LT;1% AND 5%, AND MOSTLY BETWEEN 1 AND 2%. SIMULATIONS OF TEMPERATURE AND BURIAL HISTORY IN COMBINATION WITH DEDICATED 1D SIMULATIONS OF MICROBIAL GAS GENERATION REVEAL THAT GAS GENERATION IN THE DELTA STARTED IN EARLY PLEISTOCENE CALABRIAN TIMES AND IS STILL ONGOING. SIMULATED VOLUMES OF GAS GENERATION ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO FILL PUBLISHED ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF SHALLOW GAS PROSPECTS IN THE DELTA. THE GEOMETRY OF THE E-W PROGRADING DELTA SEQUENCES AND THE CLOSE INTERBEDDING OF INTERGLACIAL SILTY/SANDY AND GLACIAL CLAYEY/SILTY SEDIMENTS FOCUS GAS MIGRATION UPDIP THROUGH THE FORESETS TOWARDS THE TOPSETS OF THE DELTA SEQUENCES, AND ULTIMATELY INTO THE ANTICLINAL STACKED TRAPS. GRAIN-SIZE BASED CALCULATIONS OF THE PERMEABILITY AND CAPILLARY SEAL CAPACITY OF CLAYEY/SILTY SEALS OF THE STRATIGRAPHIC AND ANTICLINAL TRAPS PROVIDED FIRST ESTIMATES OF PERMEABILITY VALUES RANGING FROM 2.8E-20 M2 TO 1.1E-18 M2 AND CAPILLARY SEAL CAPACITY VALUES BETWEEN 10M AND 24M. COMPARISON OF GAS COLUMN HEIGHTS DERIVED FROM GRAIN-SIZE BASED CALCULATIONS, CROSS PLOTS OF NEUTRON AND DENSITY LOGS AND PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS, WITH TRAP HEIGHTS DERIVED FROM SEISMIC BRIGHT SPOTS SUGGESTS THAT MANY TRAPS IN STACKED BRIGHT SPOTS ARE NOT FILLED TO STRUCTURAL SPILL POINT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT FILLING OF THE STACKED RESERVOIRS IS NOT RELATED TO FILL-SPILL MIGRATION, BUT RATHER TO LEAKAGE THROUGH THE TOP SEAL. IN ABSENCE OF FAULT AND FRACTURE ZONES CROSSING THE SEAL, THIS LEAKAGE IS RELATED TO THE CAPILLARY SEAL CAPACITY AND PERMEABILITY OF THE TOP SEAL. THE LEAKAGE EXTENDS, LOCALLY, TO THE SEABED. THE MICROBIAL GAS SYSTEM IN THE DELTA TODAY IS A HIGHLY DYNAMIC SYSTEM DRIVEN BY ONGOING BURIAL OF THE DELTA SEDIMENTS AND MICROBIAL GAS GENERATION. 2018",NA,NA,"VERWEIJ, J.M.; TNO NETHERLANDS ORGANISATION FOR APPLIED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, PRINCETONLAAN 6, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: HANNEKE.VERWEIJ@OUTLOOK.COM","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2018.07.034",NA,NA,"02648172","MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY","ENGLISH",4,NA,NA,"493-516","ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","GENERATION, MIGRATION, ENTRAPMENT AND LEAKAGE OF MICROBIAL GAS IN THE DUTCH PART OF THE SOUTHERN NORTH SEA DELTA","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051019598&doi=10.1016%2fj.marpetgeo.2018.07.034&partnerID=40&md5=d57d788e008af93ac50d5bb32b51ad19","97",2018,"TNO NETHERLANDS ORGANISATION FOR APPLIED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;TNO NETHERLANDS ORGANISATION FOR APPLIED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH;NOTREPORTED",NA,"VERWEIJ JM, 2018, MAR PET GEOL","VERWEIJ JM, 2018, MAR PET GEOL"

HERE, WE PRESENT THE SPECTRAL-TO-NARROWBAND ALBEDO MODULE (SNOWBAL, VERSION 1.2) TO COUPLE EFFECTIVELY A SPECTRAL ALBEDO MODEL WITH A NARROWBAND RADIATION SCHEME. SPECIFICALLY, THE TWO-STREAM RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN SNOW MODEL (TARTES) IS COUPLED WITH THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR MEDIUM-RANGE WEATHER FORECASTS (ECMWF) INTEGRATED FORECAST SYSTEM (IFS), CYCLE 33R1, ATMOSPHERIC RADIATION SCHEME BASED ON THE RAPID RADIATION TRANSFER MODEL, WHICH IS EMBEDDED IN THE REGIONAL ATMOSPHERIC CLIMATE MODEL VERSION 2.3P2 (RACMO2). THIS COUPLING ALLOWS TO EXPLICITLY ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECT OF CLOUDS, WATER VAPOR, SNOW IMPURITIES AND SNOW METAMORPHISM ON ALBEDO. FIRSTLY, WE PRESENT A NARROWBAND ALBEDO METHOD TO PROJECT THE SPECTRAL ALBEDOS OF TARTES ONTO THE 14 SPECTRAL BANDS OF THE IFS SHORTWAVE RADIATION SCHEME USING A REPRESENTATIVE WAVELENGTH (RW) FOR EACH BAND. USING TARTES AND SPECTRAL DOWNWELLING SURFACE IRRADIANCE DERIVED WITH THE DISCRETE ORDINATE RADIATIVE TRANSFER ATMOSPHERIC MODEL, WE SHOW THAT RWS PRIMARILY DEPEND ON THE SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE (SZA), CLOUD CONTENT AND WATER VAPOR. SECONDLY, WE COMPARE THE TARTES NARROWBAND ALBEDO, USING OFFLINE RACMO2 RESULTS FOR SOUTH GREENLAND, WITH THE BROADBAND ALBEDO PARAMETERIZATIONS OF <SPAN CLASSCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""CIT"" IDCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""XREF_TEXT.1""><A HREFCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""#BIB1.BIBX20"">GARDNER AND SHARP</A> (<A HREFCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""#BIB1.BIBX20"">2010</A>)</SPAN>, CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED IN RACMO2, AND THE MULTI-LAYERED PARAMETERIZATION OF <SPAN CLASSCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""CIT"" IDCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""XREF_TEXT.2""><A HREFCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""#BIB1.BIBX34"">KUIPERS MUNNEKE ET AL.</A> (<A HREFCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""#BIB1.BIBX34"">2011</A>, PKM)</SPAN>. THE ACTUAL ABSENCE OF RADIATION PENETRATION IN RACMO2 LEADS ON AVERAGE TO A HIGHER ALBEDO COMPARED WITH TARTES NARROWBAND ALBEDO. FURTHERMORE, LARGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TARTES NARROWBAND ALBEDO AND PKM AND RACMO2 ARE OBSERVED FOR HIGH SZA AND CLEAR-SKY CONDITIONS, AND AFTER MELT EVENTS WHEN THE SNOWPACK IS VERY INHOMOGENEOUS.

REP.","WHETHER A COASTAL AREA IS SUITABLE FOR BEACH NOURISHMENTS AND CAN INDUCE A GROWTH IN FRESH GROUNDWATER RESOURCES DEPENDS ON THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE INTENDED SITE FOR BEACH NOURISHMENTS, AND THE ATTAINABLE GROWTH IN FRESH GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. IN THIS STUDY WE PRESUME THAT ALL ERODING SANDY BEACHES ARE SUITABLE FOR LARGE BEACH NOURISHMENTS, AND FOCUS ON THE IMPACT OF THESE NOURISHMENTS ON FRESH GROUNDWATER IN VARIOUS COASTAL SETTINGS. THE GROWTH IN FRESH GROUNDWATER RESOURCES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF A BEACH NOURISHMENT WAS QUANTIFIED WITH 2-D VARIABLE-DENSITY GROUNDWATER MODELS, FOR A GLOBAL RANGE IN GEOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AND HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES. OUR SIMULATION RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LARGE BEACH NOURISHMENTS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO A (TEMPORARY) INCREASE OF FRESH GROUNDWATER RESOURCES IN MOST SETTINGS. HOWEVER, FOR A SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH IN FRESH GROUNDWATER, THE COASTAL SITE SHOULD RECEIVE SUFFICIENT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE, CONSIST OF SEDIMENT WITH A LOW TO MEDIUM HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, AND BE SUBJECT TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF LAND-SURFACE INUNDATIONS. OUR GLOBAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT 17% OF SHORELINES MAY CONSIST OF EROSIVE SANDY BEACHES, AND OF THESE SITES 50% HAVE A HIGH POTENTIAL SUITABILITY. THIS SHOWS A CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL WORLDWIDE TO COMBINE COASTAL PROTECTION WITH AN INCREASE IN FRESH GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. 2019, THE AUTHOR(S).","12451",NA,"HUIZER, S.; DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: S.HUIZER@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1038/s41598-019-48382-z",NA,NA,"20452322","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","ENGLISH",2,"1",NA,NA,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","31462696","SCOPUS","GLOBAL POTENTIAL FOR THE GROWTH OF FRESH GROUNDWATER RESOURCES WITH LARGE BEACH NOURISHMENTS","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071625467&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-48382-z&partnerID=40&md5=20898bea4b4d9f81e67df8a254a9ea6d","9",2019,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;DELTARES;DELTARES","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"HUIZER S, 2019, SCI REP","HUIZER S, 2019, SCI REP"

WE AIMED TO ASSESS HIV INCIDENCE AND HIV MORTALITY FOR ALL SECOND-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS ACROSS SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. METHODS: IN THIS MODELLING STUDY, WE DEVELOPED A FRAMEWORK THAT USED THE GEOGRAPHICALLY SPECIFIC HIV PREVALENCE DATA COLLECTED IN SEROPREVALENCE SURVEYS AND ANTENATAL CARE CLINICS TO TRAIN A MODEL THAT ESTIMATES HIV INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY AMONG INDIVIDUALS AGED 1549 YEARS. WE USED A MODEL-BASED GEOSTATISTICAL FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE HIV PREVALENCE AT THE SECOND ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL IN 44 COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA FOR 200018 AND SOUGHT DATA ON THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ON ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) BY SECOND-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT. WE THEN MODIFIED THE ESTIMATION AND PROJECTION PACKAGE (EPP) TO USE THESE HIV PREVALENCE AND TREATMENT ESTIMATES TO ESTIMATE HIV INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY BY SECOND-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT. FINDINGS: THE ESTIMATES SUGGEST SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION IN HIV INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY RATES BOTH BETWEEN AND WITHIN COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, WITH 15 COUNTRIES HAVING A TEN-TIMES OR GREATER DIFFERENCE IN ESTIMATED HIV INCIDENCE BETWEEN THE SECOND-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS WITH THE LOWEST AND HIGHEST ESTIMATED INCIDENCE LEVELS. ACROSS ALL 44 COUNTRIES IN 2018, HIV INCIDENCE RANGED FROM 28 (95% UNCERTAINTY INTERVAL 2138) IN MAURITANIA TO 15859 (1369418248) CASES PER 100 000 PEOPLE IN LESOTHO AND HIV MORTALITY RANGED FROM 08 (0709) IN MAURITANIA TO 6765 (51368880) DEATHS PER 100 000 PEOPLE IN LESOTHO. VARIATION IN BOTH INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY WAS SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER AT THE SUBNATIONAL LEVEL THAN AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND THE HIGHEST ESTIMATED RATES WERE ACCORDINGLY HIGHER. AMONG SECOND-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS, GUIJ DISTRICT, GAZA PROVINCE, MOZAMBIQUE, HAD THE HIGHEST ESTIMATED HIV INCIDENCE (46617 [2544881203]) CASES PER 100 000 PEOPLE IN 2018 AND INHASSUNGE DISTRICT, ZAMBEZIA PROVINCE, MOZAMBIQUE, HAD THE HIGHEST ESTIMATED HIV MORTALITY RATE (11630 [679018668]) DEATHS PER 100 000 PEOPLE. FURTHER, THE RATE OF REDUCTION IN HIV INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY FROM 2000 TO 2018, AS WELL AS THE RATIO OF NEW INFECTIONS TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV WAS HIGHLY VARIABLE. ALTHOUGH MOST SECOND-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS HAD DECLINES IN THE NUMBER OF NEW CASES (3316 [811%] OF 4087 UNITS) AND NUMBER OF DEATHS (3325 [814%]), NEARLY ALL APPEARED WELL SHORT OF THE TARGETED 75% REDUCTION IN NEW CASES AND DEATHS BETWEEN 2010 AND 2020. INTERPRETATION: OUR ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT MOST SECOND-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA ARE FALLING SHORT OF THE TARGETED 75% REDUCTION IN NEW CASES AND DEATHS BY 2020, WHICH IS FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY SUBSTANTIAL WITHIN-COUNTRY VARIABILITY. THESE ESTIMATES WILL HELP DECISION MAKERS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTERS EXPAND ACCESS TO ART AND BETTER TARGET HEALTH RESOURCES TO HIGHER BURDEN SUBNATIONAL AREAS.

A305-A312; OPENSCAD, CAD SOFTWARE, , WWW.OPENSCAD.OR","PROG PHOTOVOLTAICS RES APPL","WE PRESENT A UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE 3D-PRINTED EXTERNAL LIGHT TRAP FOR ENHANCED ABSORPTION IN SOLAR CELLS. THE MACROSCOPIC EXTERNAL LIGHT TRAP IS PLACED AT THE SUN-FACING SURFACE OF THE SOLAR CELL AND RETRO-REFLECTS THE LIGHT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE ESCAPE. THE LIGHT TRAP CONSISTS OF A REFLECTIVE PARABOLIC CONCENTRATOR PLACED ON TOP OF A REFLECTIVE CAGE. UPON PLACEMENT OF THE LIGHT TRAP, AN IMPROVEMENT OF 15% OF BOTH THE PHOTOCURRENT AND THE POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCY IN A THIN-FILM NANOCRYSTALLINE SILICON (NC-SI:H) SOLAR CELL IS MEASURED. THE TRAPPED LIGHT TRAVERSES THE SOLAR CELL SEVERAL TIMES WITHIN THE REFLECTIVE CAGE THEREBY INCREASING THE TOTAL ABSORPTION IN THE CELL. CONSEQUENTLY, THE TRAP REDUCES OPTICAL LOSSES AND ENHANCES THE ABSORPTION OVER THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM. THE COMPONENTS OF THE LIGHT TRAP ARE 3D PRINTED AND MADE OF SMOOTHENED, SILVER-COATED THERMOPLASTIC. IN CONTRAST TO CONVENTIONAL LIGHT TRAPPING METHODS, EXTERNAL LIGHT TRAPPING LEAVES THE MATERIAL QUALITY AND THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOLAR CELL UNAFFECTED. TO EXPLAIN THE THEORETICAL OPERATION OF THE EXTERNAL LIGHT TRAP, WE INTRODUCE A MODEL THAT PREDICTS THE ABSORPTION ENHANCEMENT IN THE SOLAR CELL BY THE EXTERNAL LIGHT TRAP. THE CORRESPONDING CALCULATED PATH LENGTH ENHANCEMENT SHOWS GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE EMPIRICALLY DERIVED VALUE FROM THE OPTO-ELECTRICAL DATA OF THE SOLAR CELL. MOREOVER, WE ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE ON THE PARASITIC ABSORPTANCE TO OBTAIN FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRAP PERFORMANCE. 2015 THE AUTHORS.

RES.","CYCLIC ADSORPTION PROCESSES FOR GAS SEPARATION, SUCH AS PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE SWING ADSORPTION (PSA AND TSA), ARE NONSTATIONARY MULTICOLUMN PROCESSES. THEIR DESIGN INVOLVES MANY DEGREES OF FREEDOM, WHICH OFFERS A VERY HIGH FLEXIBILITY WHILE CALLING FOR A SYSTEMATIC AND RIGOROUS OPTIMIZATION APPROACH. AS AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE, OPTIMIZATION OF THESE SEPARATION PROCESSES INVOLVES MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES, E.G., MINIMAL ENERGY DEMAND AND MAXIMAL PRODUCTIVITY, WHICH HAVE TO BE PURSUED WHILE FULFILLING GIVEN PROCESS SPECIFICATIONS, E.G., PURITY AND RECOVERY OF THE TARGET COMPONENTS. THIS WORK EXTENDS THE MULTILEVEL COORDINATE SEARCH (MCS), A WELL-KNOWN MODEL-BASED DERIVATIVE-FREE ALGORITHM, TO CONSTRAINED MULTIOBJECTIVE PROBLEMS. THE ALGORITHM, CALLED MO-MCS, COMBINES A BUILT-IN PARALLEL COMPUTING STRATEGY WITH THE USE OF LOOK-UP TABLES WITH THE GOAL OF MINIMIZING THE COMPUTATIONAL TIME NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE PARETO CURVE. THE COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART OPTIMIZERS INDICATES THAT MO-MCS SHOWS BETTER PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF OPTIMALITY, WELL SPACING, AND EXTENSION OF THE PARETO CURVE. AFTERWARD, TWO INDUSTRIALLY RELEVANT CASE STUDIES (TSA FOR CO2 SEPARATION AND PSA FOR H2 AND CO2 COPRODUCTION) ARE TACKLED TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ALGORITHM AS A TOOL TO GUIDE THE DESIGN OF ADSORPTION PROCESSES. 2018 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY.",NA,"IECRE","MARTELLI, E.; POLITECNICO DI MILANO, VIA LAMBRUSCHINI 4, ITALY; EMAIL: EMANUELE.MARTELLI@POLIMI.IT","ARTICLE","10.1021/acs.iecr.8b00207",NA,NA,"08885885","INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH","ENGLISH",13,"30",NA,"9977-9993","AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY",NA,"SCOPUS","MO-MCS, A DERIVATIVE-FREE ALGORITHM FOR THE MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION OF ADSORPTION PROCESSES","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047405130&doi=10.1021%2facs.iecr.8b00207&partnerID=40&md5=b12de235720f0d734f9a042b14d5b5f4","57",2018,"POLITECNICO DI MILANO;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON;INSTITUTE OF PROCESS ENGINEERING","NOTREPORTED;NOTDECLARED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"CAPRA F, 2018, IND ENG CHEM RES","CAPRA F, 2018, IND ENG CHEM RES"

CHEM. PHYS., 12, PP. 4539-455","GLOBAL PLANET. CHANGE","NITROGEN (N) AND PHOSPHORUS (P) PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL FUNCTIONING OF AQUATIC SYSTEMS. N AND P TRANSFER TO SURFACE FRESHWATERS HAS AMPLIFIED DURING THE 20TH CENTURY, WHICH HAS LED TO WIDESPREAD EUTROPHICATION PROBLEMS. THE CONTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT SOURCES, NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC, TO TOTAL N AND P LOADING TO RIVER NETWORKS HAS RECENTLY BEEN ESTIMATED YEARLY USING THE INTEGRATED MODEL TO ASSESS THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT - GLOBAL NUTRIENT MODEL (IMAGE-GNM). HOWEVER, EUTROPHIC EVENTS GENERALLY RESULT FROM A COMBINATION OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL CONDITIONS GOVERNED BY HYDROLOGICAL DYNAMICS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIFIC NUTRIENT FORMS THAT VARY AT SUBYEARLY TIMESCALES. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE DEFINE FOR EACH SIMULATED NUTRIENT SOURCE: I) ITS SPECIATION, AND II) ITS SUBANNUAL TEMPORAL PATTERN. THEREBY, WE SIMULATE THE MONTHLY LOADS OF DIFFERENT N (AMMONIUM, NITRATE + NITRITE, AND ORGANIC N) AND P FORMS (DISSOLVED AND PARTICULATE INORGANIC P, AND ORGANIC P) TO GLOBAL RIVER NETWORKS OVER THE WHOLE 20TH CENTURY AT A HALF-DEGREE SPATIAL RESOLUTION. RESULTS INDICATE THAT, TOGETHER WITH AN INCREASE IN THE DELIVERY OF ALL NUTRIENT FORMS TO GLOBAL RIVERS, THE PROPORTION OF INORGANIC FORMS IN TOTAL N AND P INPUTS HAS RISEN FROM 30 TO 43% AND FROM 56 TO 65%, RESPECTIVELY. THE HIGH LOADS ORIGINATING FROM FERTILIZED AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND THE INCREASING PROPORTION OF SEWAGE INPUTS HAVE LED TO A GREATER PROPORTION OF DIN FORMS (AMMONIUM AND NITRATE), THAT ARE USUALLY MORE BIOAVAILABLE. SOIL LOSS FROM AGRICULTURAL LANDS, WHICH DELIVERS LARGE AMOUNTS OF PARTICLE-BOUND INORGANIC P TO SURFACE FRESHWATERS, HAS BECOME THE DOMINANT P SOURCE, WHICH IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO AN INCREASED ACCUMULATION OF LEGACY P IN SLOW FLOWING AREAS (E.G., LAKES AND RESERVOIRS). WHILE THE TN:TP RATIO OF THE LOADS HAS REMAINED QUITE STABLE, THE DIN:DIP MOLAR RATIO, WHICH IS LIKELY TO AFFECT ALGAL DEVELOPMENT THE MOST, HAS INCREASED FROM 18 TO 27 GLOBALLY.

WE DESIGNED A REPEATED 4 4 LATIN SQUARE TO CONTROL FOR CONFOUNDING FACTORS SUCH AS; CARRY-OVER EFFECTS, LEARNING OF A PREFERENTIAL TASTE, DAILY VARIATION WITHIN GROUPS AND REGULAR INCREASE OF UPTAKE OVER A DAY DUE TO DIURNAL DRINKING PATTERNS. WATER TYPES TESTED WERE CONTROL WATER (A); WARM WATER (33 C); (B); ORGANIC ACID ADDITIVE 1 (C), AND ORGANIC ACID ADDITIVE 2 (D). RESULTS: THE PIGLETS DRANK MORE OF WATER C THAN OF CONTROL WATER (A). THE UPTAKE OF WATER D WAS MARGINALLY HIGHER THAN CONTROL WATER (A). THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN UPTAKE OF WATER B AND A. HOWEVER, A LEARNING EFFECT WAS OBSERVED RESULTING IN INCREASING AMOUNTS OF WATER TYPE C AND D TAKEN UP OVER THE FOUR CONSECUTIVE DAYS. A CARRYOVER WAS NOT FULLY PREVENTED AS PIGS ALWAYS CONSUMED LESS DURING THE SECOND HOUR AND WATER D WAS CONSUMED LESS DURING THE FOURTH AND FINAL HOURLY OBSERVATION PERIOD EACH DAY. CONCLUSIONS: THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN CAN BE USED IN FUTURE TRIALS FOR EVALUATION OF THE WATER UPTAKE AND PREFERENCE OF WATER ADDITIVES FOR PIGS. THE TESTED COMMERCIAL ORGANIC ACID ADDITIVES DID NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT WATER UPTAKE OF DRINKING WATER, WATER UPTAKE INCREASED INSTEAD. THE AUTHOR(S). 2018.","10",NA,"TOBIAS, T.J.; PORQ BV, P.O.

GEOPHYS. RES. SOLID EARTH","LONG-TERM MONITORING OF GLOBAL MASS TRANSPORT WITHIN THE EARTH SYSTEM IMPROVES OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE NATURAL HAZARDS AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR RELATIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. SATELLITE GRAVITY IS WIDELY USED TO MONITOR SURFACE MASS VARIATIONS FOR ITS UNPRECEDENTED SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL COVERAGE. HOWEVER, THE GRAVITY DATA CONTAIN SIGNALS FROM VISCO-ELASTIC DEFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO PAST ICE SHEET MELTING, PREVENTING US FROM EXTRACTING SIGNALS OF PRESENT-DAY SURFACE MASS TREND (PDMT) DIRECTLY. HERE WE PRESENT A GLOBAL INVERSION SCHEME THAT SEPARATES PDMT AND VISCO-ELASTIC GLACIAL ISOSTATIC ADJUSTMENT (GIA) SIGNATURES BY COMBINING SATELLITE GRAVIMETRY WITH SATELLITE ALTIMETRY AND GROUND OBSERVATIONS. OUR INVERSION PROVIDES GLOBAL DUAL DATA COVERAGE THAT ENABLES A ROBUST SEPARATION OF PDMT AND GIA SPHERICAL HARMONIC COEFFICIENTS. IT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF PROVIDING ESTIMATES OF EARTH'S LONG WAVELENGTH DEFORMATION SIGNATURES AND THEIR UNCERTAINTIES. OUR GIA RESULT, ALONG WITH ITS UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATES, CAN BE USED IN FUTURE GRACE PROCESSING TO BETTER ASSESS THE IMPACT OF GIA ON SURFACE MASS CHANGE. OUR GIA ESTIMATES INCLUDE A RAPID GIA UPLIFT IN THE SOUTHEAST ALASKA AND THE AMUNDSEN SEA EMBAYMENT, DUE TO THE VISCO-ELASTIC RESPONSE TO RECENT GLACIAL UNLOADING. WE ESTIMATE THE AVERAGE SURFACE MASS CHANGE RATE FROM 20022010 TO BE 2033GTA1 IN GREENLAND, 12618GTA1 IN ANTARCTICA AND, 625GTA1 IN ALASKA. THE GIA LOW DEGREE SPHERICAL HARMONIC COEFFICIENTS ARE SENSITIVE TO RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES IN EARTH'S DEEP INTERIOR. OUR LOW-DEGREE GIA ESTIMATES INCLUDE GEOCENTER MOTION AND (FORMULA PRESENTED.) WHICH PROVIDE UNIQUE CONSTRAINTS TO UNDERSTAND EARTH'S LOWER MANTLE AND ICE HISTORY. 2021. HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA. JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH.

TO QUANTIFY THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE IMPACTS, CLIMATE MODELS NEED CONSISTENT LAND-COVER CHANGE TIME SERIES AT A GLOBAL SCALE, BASED ON LAND-USE INFORMATION FROM OBSERVATIONS OR DEDICATED LAND-USE CHANGE MODELS. HOWEVER, A SPECIFIC LAND-USE CHANGE CANNOT BE UNAMBIGUOUSLY MAPPED TO A SPECIFIC LAND-COVER CHANGE. HERE, NINE TRANSLATION RULES ARE EVALUATED BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE WAY LAND-USE CHANGE COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT LAND COVER. UTILIZING THE GLOBAL LAND-USE MODEL 2 (GLM2), THE MODEL UNDERLYING THE LATEST LAND-USE HARMONIZATION DATASET (LUH2), THE LAND-COVER DYNAMICS RESULTING FROM LAND-USE CHANGE WERE SIMULATED BASED ON MULTIPLE ALTERNATIVE TRANSLATION RULES FROM 850 TO 2015 GLOBALLY. FOR EACH RULE, THE RESULTING FOREST COVER, CARBON DENSITY AND CARBON EMISSIONS WERE COMPARED WITH INDEPENDENT ESTIMATES FROM REMOTE SENSING OBSERVATIONS, U.N. FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION REPORTS, AND OTHER STUDIES. THE TRANSLATION RULE PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED BY THE AUTHORS OF THE HYDE 3.2 DATASET, THAT UNDERLIES LUH2, IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RESULTS OF OUR EXAMINATIONS AT GLOBAL, COUNTRY AND GRID SCALES. THIS RULE RECOMMENDS THAT FOR CMIP6 SIMULATIONS, MODELS SHOULD (1) COMPLETELY CLEAR VEGETATION IN LAND-USE CHANGES FROM PRIMARY AND SECONDARY LAND (INCLUDING BOTH FORESTED AND NON-FORESTED) TO CROPLAND, URBAN LAND AND MANAGED PASTURE; (2) COMPLETELY CLEAR VEGETATION IN LAND-USE CHANGES FROM PRIMARY FOREST AND/OR SECONDARY FOREST TO RANGELAND; (3) KEEP VEGETATION IN LAND-USE CHANGES FROM PRIMARY NON-FOREST AND/OR SECONDARY NON-FOREST TO RANGELAND. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THIS RULE IS ONE OF THREE (OUT OF NINE) RULES THAT PRODUCE COMPARABLE ESTIMATES OF FOREST COVER, VEGETATION CARBON AND EMISSIONS TO INDEPENDENT ESTIMATES AND ALSO MITIGATE THE ANOMALOUSLY HIGH CARBON EMISSIONS FROM LAND-USE CHANGE OBSERVED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES IN THE 1950S. ACCORDING TO THE THREE TRANSLATION RULES, CONTEMPORARY GLOBAL FOREST AREA IS ESTIMATED TO BE SPAN CLASSCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""INLINE-FORMULA""37.42106/SPAN&THINSP;KMSPAN CLASSCOMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE""INLINE-FORMULA""2/SPAN, WITHIN THE RANGE DERIVED FROM REMOTE SENSING PRODUCTS.

HOW NUDGES INTERACT WITH INDIVIDUALS MOTIVATION HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED EMPIRICALLY. WE CONDUCTED THREE STUDIES WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEFAULTS IN THREE DIFFERENT BEHAVIORAL DOMAINS AND INVESTIGATED HOW DEFAULTS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOTIVATION AFFECT CHOICE OUTCOMES. IN STUDY 1, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A DEFAULT TO STIMULATE HEALTHY EATING CHOICES IMPLEMENTED IN A HYPOTHETICAL ONLINE SUPERMARKET SETTING. IN STUDY 2, WE USED A SCENARIO IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS COULD CHOOSE FROM A LIST OF GREEN AMENITIES (EITHER PRESELECTED OR NOT). IN STUDY 3, WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS WHETHER THEY WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN A BASIC OR LONGER VERSION OF OUR QUESTIONNAIRE, WITH THE LONGER VERSION OPTION SET AS THE DEFAULT IN THE NUDGE CONDITION. ACROSS THESE THREE STUDIES WE SHOW THAT DEFAULTS ARE EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING DESIRABLE BEHAVIOR AND THAT GOAL STRIVINGS AND AUTONOMOUS MOTIVATION HAVE ADDITIONAL POSITIVE MAIN EFFECTS. WE DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE THAT CONTROLLED MOTIVATION AFFECTED BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES. EXPLORATORY ANALYSES REVEALED THAT AMOTIVATION NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BEHAVIOR, BUT THE MEASURE HAD POOR RELIABILITY. NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED. TOGETHER, THESE STUDIES IMPLY THAT BOTH DEFAULTS AND MOTIVATION HAVE MAIN EFFECTS ON BEHAVIOR, SUCH THAT THE DEFAULT SETS THE ANCHOR FROM WHICH PEOPLE CAN ADJUST ACCORDING TO THE TYPE AND STRENGTH OF THEIR MOTIVATION.

TIME-SERIES OF SURFACE UPWELLING PAR, DOWNWELLING PAR, AND UNDER-ICE PAR WERE ALSO OBTAINED. SPECTRAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF UPWELLING AND DOWNWELLING IRRADIANCES WERE SIMILAR EXCEPT FOR REDUCED INTENSITIES IN THE UV, THE RED, AND NIR PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM WHEN THE ICE WAS SNOW-COVERED. UPWELLING PAR AMOUNTED TO ABOUT 10% OF DOWNWELLING INTENSITIES, GIVING 5.1 MOL PHOTONS M2 S1 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ICE WITH A SNOW COVER AND 8.2 MOL PHOTONS M2 S1 WITHOUT. PAR PARTITIONING ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE UPWELLING WAS RELATED TO SCATTERING BY SUSPENDED PARTICLES IN THE WATER COLUMN. A SNOW MELT INCREASED UNDER-ICE DAILY MAXIMUM DOWNWELLING PAR FROM 50 TO 180 MOL PHOTONS M2 S1 AND OVERALL UNDER-ICE PAR OF 55 AND 198 MOL PHOTONS M2 S1 WITH 10% UPWELLING.

THESE EVENTS CONVERT SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF CARBON STORED AS PEAT TO ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION ON A REGIONAL TO GLOBAL SCALE. DURING THE RECENT 2015 EL NIO EVENT, PEAT FIRES LED TO STRONG ENHANCEMENTS OF CARBON MONOXIDE (CO), AN AIR POLLUTANT AND WELL-KNOWN TRACER FOR BIOMASS BURNING. THESE ENHANCEMENTS WERE CLEARLY OBSERVED FROM SPACE BY THE INFRARED ATMOSPHERIC SOUNDING INTERFEROMETER (IASI) AND THE MEASUREMENTS OF POLLUTION IN THE TROPOSPHERE (MOPITT) INSTRUMENTS. WE USE THESE SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS TO ESTIMATE CO FIRE EMISSIONS WITHIN AN INVERSE MODELLING FRAMEWORK. WE FIND THAT THE DERIVED CO EMISSIONS FOR EACH SUB-REGION OF INDONESIA AND PAPUA ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM EMISSION INVENTORIES, HIGHLIGHTING UNCERTAINTIES IN BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATES. CO FIRE EMISSIONS BASED ON EITHER MOPITT OR IASI HAVE A SIMILAR SPATIAL PATTERN AND EVOLUTION IN TIME, AND A 10% UNCERTAINTY BASED ON A SET OF SENSITIVITY TESTS WE PERFORMED. THUS, CO SATELLITE DATA HAVE A HIGH POTENTIAL TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING OPERATIONAL FIRE EMISSION ESTIMATES BASED ON SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS OF FIRE COUNTS, FIRE RADIATIVE POWER AND BURNED AREA, IN BETTER CONSTRAINING FIRE OCCURRENCE AND THE ASSOCIATED CONVERSION OF PEAT CARBON TO ATMOSPHERIC CO2. A TOTAL CARBON RELEASE TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF 0.350.60 PG C CAN BE ESTIMATED BASED ON OUR RESULTS.

CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY VIEWED AS A 'THREAT MULTIPLIER'. HOWEVER, THE GEOPHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE SOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY MEDIATED BY ACTORS WITH UNEVEN POWER, CAPACITY AND DIVERGENT INTERESTS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT EITHER INCUMBENT OR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PATHWAYS. WHILE CLIMATE CHANGE INTENSIFIES AND MAGNIFIES EXISTING TENSIONS AND CONTRADICTIONS IN GLOBAL ENERGY POLITICS AROUND THE SIMULTANEOUS PURSUIT OF GROWTH, SECURITY AND SUSTAINABILITY, IT DOES NOT DO SO IN ANY STRAIGHTFORWARD OR UNMEDIATED WAY. INSTEAD, IT GIVES RISE TO NEW CONCERNS IN RELATION TO THE IMPERATIVES OF DE-CARBONIZATION AND INCREASING THE RESILIENCE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS. UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON ENERGY SYSTEMS REQUIRES TAKING SERIOUSLY THE NECESSARY ROLE OF ENERGY WITHIN THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOSSIL FUELS AND CAPITALISM.

ACTA","THE EXTENT TO WHICH OCEANS ARE CAPABLE OF BUFFERING CHEMICAL CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE UPTAKE OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) OR OTHER ACIDIFYING PROCESSES CAN BE QUANTIFIED USING BUFFER FACTORS. HERE, WE PRESENT GENERAL EXPRESSIONS DESCRIBING THE SENSITIVITY OF PH AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CO2 AND OTHER ACID-BASE SPECIES TO A CHANGE IN OCEAN CHEMISTRY. THESE EXPRESSIONS CAN INCLUDE AS MANY ACID-BASE SYSTEMS AS DESIRABLE, MAKING THEM SUITABLE FOR APPLICATION TO, E.G., UPWELLING REGIONS OR NUTRIENT-RICH COASTAL WATERS. WE SHOW THAT THESE EXPRESSIONS ARE FULLY CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUSLY DERIVED EXPRESSIONS FOR THE REVELLE FACTOR AND OTHER BUFFER FACTORS, WHICH ONLY INCLUDED THE CARBONATE AND BORATE ACID-BASE SYSTEMS, AND PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE VALUES.WE APPLY OUR GENERAL EXPRESSIONS TO CONTEMPORARY GLOBAL OCEAN SURFACE WATER AND POSSIBLE CHANGES THEREIN BY THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT MOST SENSITIVITIES DESCRIBING A CHANGE IN PH ARE OF GREATER MAGNITUDE IN A WARMER, HIGH-CO2 OCEAN, INDICATING A DECREASED SEAWATER BUFFERING CAPACITY. THIS TREND IS DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN CO2 AND SLIGHTLY MODERATED BY THE WARMING. RESPIRATION-DERIVED CARBON DIOXIDE MAY AMPLIFY OR ATTENUATE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION DUE TO RISING ATMOSPHERIC CO2, DEPENDING ON THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE. OUR WORK HIGHLIGHTS THAT, TO GAIN FURTHER INSIGHT INTO CURRENT AND FUTURE PH DYNAMICS, IT IS CRUCIAL TO PROPERLY QUANTIFY THE VARIOUS CONCURRENTLY ACTING BUFFERING MECHANISMS. 2016 ELSEVIER LTD.",NA,NA,"HAGENS, M.; DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES - GEOCHEMISTRY, P.O.

COPPER AND NICKEL ARE ALSO KEY ELEMENTS FOR THE TRANSITION TO A FOSSIL FREE ELECTRIC ENERGY PRODUCTION, WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR THESE METALS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AND AT WHICH CONDITIONS A SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION RATE OF COPPER AND NICKEL CAN BE COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE OF THE SERVICE LEVEL OF THE TWO METALS FOR THE ENTIRE FUTURE WORLD POPULATION TO THE SAME LEVEL AS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN 2020. WE CONSIDER THREE AMBITION LEVELS WITH REGARD TO A SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION RATE FOR COPPER AND NICKEL: 1000 YEARS, 500 YEARS AND 200 YEARS OF GUARANTEED, SUFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE SUPPLY TO THE ENTIRE WORLD POPULATION AT A SERVICE LEVEL, WHICH, IN ALL COUNTRIES, IS EQUAL TO THE SERVICE LEVEL IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN 2020. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE HIGHEST SUSTAINABILITY AMBITION (1000 YEARS) IS ONLY ACHIEVABLE WITH A COMBINATION OF AN OPTIMISTICALLY LARGE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES IN COMBINATION WITH A HIGH END-OF-LIFE RECYCLING RATE. WHETHER THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF RESOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR AN AFFORDABLE PRICE, REMAINS UNCERTAIN. 2020 THE AUTHORS","121460","JCROE","HENCKENS, M.L.C.M.; UTRECHT UNIVERSITY, PRINCETONLAAN 8A, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: M.L.C.M.HENCKENS@UU.NL","REVIEW","10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121460",NA,NA,"09596526","JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION","ENGLISH",10,NA,NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","REVIEWING THE AVAILABILITY OF COPPER AND NICKEL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

WHEREAS TEMPERATURE SENSING AND -EFFECTUATING PROCESSES OCCUR IN PART UNCONSCIOUSLY AND AUTONOMIC, AWARENESS OF TEMPERATURE AND THERMAL PREFERENCES CAN AFFECT THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOR AS WELL. QUANTIFICATION OF TRAIT-LIKE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES OF THERMAL PREFERENCES AND EXPERIENCED TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY AND REGULATION IS THEREFORE RELEVANT TO OBTAIN A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN THERMOPHYSIOLOGY. WHEREAS SEVERAL SCALES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ASSESS INSTANTANEOUS APPRECIATION OF HEAT AND COLD EXPOSURE, A COMPREHENSIVE SCALE DEDICATED TO ASSESS SUBJECTIVELY EXPERIENCED AUTONOMIC OR BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATORY ACTIVITY HAS BEEN LACKING SO FAR. WE CONSTRUCTED A SURVEY THAT SPECIFICALLY APPROACHES THESE DOMAINS FROM A TRAIT-LIKE PERSPECTIVE, SAMPLED 240 VOLUNTEERS ACROSS A WIDE AGE RANGE, AND ANALYZED THE EMERGENT COMPONENT STRUCTURE. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO REPORT THEIR THERMAL EXPERIENCES, CAPTURED IN 102 QUESTIONS, ON A 7-POINT BI-DIRECTIONAL LIKERT SCALE. IN A SECOND SET OF 32 QUESTIONS, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO INDICATE THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF EXPERIENCES ACROSS DIFFERENT BODY LOCATIONS. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSES EXTRACTED 21 MEANINGFUL DIMENSIONS, WHICH WERE SENSITIVE TO SEX-DIFFERENCES AND AGE-RELATED CHANGES. THE QUESTIONS WERE ALSO ASSESSED IN A MATCHED SAMPLE OF 240 PEOPLE WITH PROBABLE INSOMNIA TO EVALUATE THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE DIMENSIONS TO DETECT GROUP DIFFERENCES IN A CASE-CONTROL DESIGN. THE DIMENSIONS SHOWED MARKED MEAN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CASES AND CONTROLS. THE SURVEY THUS HAS DISCRIMINATORY VALUE.

THESE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE CULTURAL PRESENCE, THE PRODUCTION AND DISSEMINATION OF GAMES, WHICH IN TURN HAVE LED TO CHANGES IN THEIR CONTENT AND FORMS. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES TO WHAT EXTEND SUCH GAME SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED BY GAMES IN A FUTURES CONTEXT, AND BUILDING ON THIS ANALYSIS, WHERE THE KEY OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO LEVERAGE GAME SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS TO ADVANCE THE FIELD OF FUTURES GAMES. CONNECTIONS ARE MADE BETWEEN GAME SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS ON THE ONE HAND AND ALTERNATE REALITY GAMES, MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER GAMES, EXPERIENTIAL FUTURES GAMES, ONLINE VIDEO GAMES, GAME DESIGN ENGINES AND GAME JAMS ON THE OTHER. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS RESULTING FROM THIS ANALYSIS INCLUDE RESEARCHING NEW PLAYER BASES, ADAPTING EXISTING GAMES, BLURRING THE LINES BETWEEN COMMERCIAL GAMES AND FUTURES GAMES, DEVELOPING NEW FUTURES GAMES DESIGN AND DISSEMINATION INFRASTRUCTURE, INTEGRATING FUTURES GAMES AND PRESENT ACTION, AND ORGANIZING NEW FUNDING MECHANISMS FOR FUTURES GAMES. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,NA,"VERVOORT, J.M.; COPERNICUS INSTITUTE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, PRINCETONLAAN 8A, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: J.M.VERVOORT@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.futures.2018.10.005",NA,NA,"00163287","FUTURES","ENGLISH",18,NA,NA,"174-186","ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","NEW FRONTIERS IN FUTURES GAMES: LEVERAGING GAME SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055730553&doi=10.1016%2fj.futures.2018.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=03160851c0be8bfb585edaaf59da7baf","105",2019,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD","NOTREPORTED;COPERNICUS INSTITUTE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT;NOTREPORTED",NA,"VERVOORT JM, 2019, FUTURES","VERVOORT JM, 2019, FUTURES"

WE USED OBSERVATIONS FROM AN AUTOMATIC WEATHER STATION AT CABINET INLET ON THE NORTHERN LARSEN C ICE SHELF BETWEEN 25 NOVEMBER 2014 AND 31 DECEMBER 2016 TO DESCRIBE FHN DYNAMICS. OBSERVED FHN FREQUENCY WAS COMPARED TO THE LATEST VERSION OF THE REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL RACMO2.3P2, RUN OVER THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA AT 5.5-KM HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION. A FHN IDENTIFICATION SCHEME BASED ON OBSERVED WIND CONDITIONS WAS EMPLOYED TO CHECK FOR MODEL BIASES IN FHN REPRESENTATION. SEASONAL VARIATION IN TOTAL FHN EVENT DURATION WAS RESOLVED WITH SUFFICIENT SKILL. THE ANALYSIS WAS EXTENDED TO THE MODEL PERIOD (1979-2016) TO OBTAIN A MULTIDECADAL PERSPECTIVE OF FHN OCCURRENCE OVER LARSEN C ICE SHELF. FHN OCCURRENCE AT CABINET INLET STRONGLY CORRELATES WITH NEAR-SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE, AND BOTH ARE FOUND TO RELATE STRONGLY TO THE LOCATION AND STRENGTH OF THE AMUNDSEN SEA LOW. FURTHERMORE, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT FHN OCCURRENCE OVER LARSEN C ICE SHELF SHOWS HIGH VARIABILITY IN SPACE AND TIME. 2018 BY THE AUTHORS.","172",NA,"WIESENEKKER, J.M.; INSTITUTE FOR MARINE AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: JMWIESENEKKER@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.3390/atmos9050172",NA,NA,"20734433","ATMOSPHERE","ENGLISH",19,"5",NA,NA,"MDPI AG",NA,"SCOPUS","A MULTIDECADAL ANALYSIS OF FHN WINDS OVER LARSEN C ICE SHELF FROM A COMBINATION OF OBSERVATIONS AND MODELING","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046694764&doi=10.3390%2fatmos9050172&partnerID=40&md5=b73ff68fead6c885686defe1bfb35397","9",2018,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;INSTITUTE FOR MARINE AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH;NOTREPORTED",NA,"WIESENEKKER JM, 2018, ATMOSPHERE","WIESENEKKER JM, 2018, ATMOSPHERE"

APPL.","IN DEGRADED LANDSCAPES, RECOLONIZATION BY PIONEER VEGETATION IS OFTEN HALTED BY THE PRESENCE OF PERSISTENT ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS. WHEN NATURAL EXPANSION DOES OCCUR, IT IS COMMONLY DUE TO THE MOMENTARY ALLEVIATION OF A KEY ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE PREVIOUSLY LIMITING NEW GROWTH. THUS, STUDYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH EXPANSION OCCURS CAN INSPIRE NEW RESTORATION TECHNIQUES, WHEREIN VEGETATION ESTABLISHMENT IS PROVOKED BY EMULATING NATURAL EVENTS THROUGH ARTIFICIAL MEANS. USING THE SALT-MARSH PIONEER ZONE ON TIDAL FLATS AS A BIOGEOMORPHIC MODEL SYSTEM, WE EXPLORE HOW LOCALLY RAISED SEDIMENT BED FORMS, WHICH ARE THE RESULT OF NATURAL (BIO)GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES, ENHANCE SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT IN AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. WE THEN CONDUCT A MANIPULATIVE EXPERIMENT DESIGNED TO EMULATE THESE FACILITATIVE CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO ENABLE ESTABLISHMENT ON AN UNCOLONIZED TIDAL FLAT. HERE, WE ATTEMPT TO GENERATE RAISED GROWTH-PROMOTING SEDIMENT BED FORMS USING POROUS ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES. FLUME EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATE HOW THESE STRUCTURES PRODUCE A SHELTERED HYDRODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SUSPENDED SEDIMENT AND SEEDS PREFERENTIALLY SETTLE. THE APPLICATION OF THESE STRUCTURES IN THE FIELD LED TO THE FORMATION OF STABLE, RAISED SEDIMENT PLATFORMS AND THE SPONTANEOUS RECRUITMENT OF SALT-MARSH PIONEERS IN THE FOLLOWING GROWING SEASON. THESE RECRUITS WERE COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF THE ANNUAL PIONEERING SALICORNIA GENUS, WITH DENSITIES OF UP TO 140INDIVIDUALS/M2 WITHIN THE STRUCTURES, A 60-FOLD INCREASE OVER AMBIENT DENSITIES. LOWER ABUNDANCES OF FIVE OTHER PERENNIAL SPECIES WERE FOUND WITHIN STRUCTURES THAT DID NOT APPEAR ELSEWHERE IN THE PIONEER ZONE. FURTHERMORE, RECRUITS GREW TO BE ON AVERAGE THREE TIMES GREATER IN MASS INSIDE OF THE STRUCTURES THAN IN THE NEIGHBORING AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT. THE SUCCESS OF THIS RESTORATION DESIGN MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE COMBINATION OF THREE FACTORS: (1) ENHANCED SEED RETENTION, (2) SUPPRESSED MORTALITY, AND (3) ACCELERATED GROWTH RATES ON THE ELEVATED SURFACES GENERATED BY THE ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES. WE ARGUE THAT RESTORATION APPROACHES SIMILAR TO THE ONE SHOWN HERE, WHEREIN THE CONDITIONS FOR NATURAL ESTABLISHMENT ARE ACTIVELY MIMICKED TO PROMOTE VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT, MAY SERVE AS PROMISING TOOLS IN MANY BIOGEOMORPHIC ECOSYSTEMS, RANGING FROM COASTAL TO ARID ECOSYSTEMS. 2021 THE AUTHORS.

PLANT SCI.","HUMAN ACTIVITY IS CURRENTLY CHANGING OUR ENVIRONMENT RAPIDLY, WITH PREDICTED TEMPERATURE INCREASES OF 15 C OVER THE COMING CENTURY AND INCREASED NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS INPUTS IN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. IN THE SHALLOW PARTS OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS, SUBMERGED AQUATIC PLANTS ENHANCE WATER CLARITY BY RESOURCE COMPETITION WITH PHYTOPLANKTON, PROVIDE HABITAT, AND SERVE AS A FOOD SOURCE FOR OTHER ORGANISMS. THE CARBON:NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY OF SUBMERGED AQUATIC PLANTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BOTH TEMPERATURE AND NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT ELEVATED TEMPERATURE LEADS TO HIGHER CARBON:NUTRIENT RATIOS THROUGH ENHANCED NUTRIENT-USE EFFICIENCY, WHILE NUTRIENT ADDITION LEADS TO LOWER CARBON:NUTRIENT RATIOS BY THE LUXURIOUS UPTAKE OF NUTRIENTS. WE ADDRESSED THESE HYPOTHESES WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL AND A META-ANALYTICAL APPROACH. WE PERFORMED A FULL-FACTORIAL MICROCOSM EXPERIMENT WITH THE FRESHWATER PLANT ELODEA NUTTALLII GROWN AT 10, 15, 20, AND 25 C ON SEDIMENT CONSISTING OF POND SOIL/SAND MIXTURES WITH 100, 50, 25, AND 12.5%POND SOIL. TO ADDRESS THE EFFECT OF CLIMATIC WARMING AND NUTRIENT ADDITION ON THE CARBON:NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY OF SUBMERGED FRESHWATER AND MARINE PLANTS WE PERFORMED A META-ANALYSIS ON EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES THAT ELEVATED TEMPERATURE AND/OR ADDED NUTRIENTS (NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS). IN THE MICROCOSM EXPERIMENT, C:N RATIOS OF ELODEA NUTTALLII DECREASED WITH INCREASING TEMPERATURE, AND THIS EFFECT WAS MOST PRONOUNCED AT INTERMEDIATE NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY. FURTHERMORE, HIGHER NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY LED TO DECREASED ABOVEGROUND C:P RATIOS. IN THE META-ANALYSIS, NUTRIENT ADDITION LED TO A 25, 22, AND 16% REDUCTION IN ABOVEGROUND C:N AND C:P RATIOS AND BELOWGROUND C:N RATIOS, ACCOMPANIED WITH INCREASED N CONTENT. NO CONSISTENT EFFECT OF ELEVATED TEMPERATURE ON PLANT STOICHIOMETRY COULD BE OBSERVED, AS VERY FEW STUDIES WERE FOUND ON THIS TOPIC AND CONTRASTING RESULTS WERE REPORTED. WE CONCLUDE THAT WHILE NUTRIENT ADDITION CONSISTENTLY LEADS TO DECREASED CARBON:NUTRIENT RATIOS, ELEVATED TEMPERATURE DOES NOT CHANGE SUBMERGED AQUATIC PLANT CARBON:NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY IN A CONSISTENT MANNER. THIS EFFECT IS RATHER DEPENDENT ON NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AND MAY BE SPECIES-SPECIFIC. AS CHANGES IN THE CARBON:NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY OF SUBMERGED AQUATIC PLANTS CAN IMPACT THE TRANSFER OF ENERGY TO HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT EUTROPHICATION MAY ENHANCE PLANT CONSUMPTION AND DECOMPOSITION, WHICH COULD IN TURN HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION. 2017 VELTHUIS, VAN DEELEN, VAN DONK, ZHANG AND BAKKER.","655",NA,"VELTHUIS, M.; DEPARTMENT OF AQUATIC ECOLOGY, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: M.VELTHUIS@NIOO.KNAW.NL","ARTICLE","10.3389/fpls.2017.00655",NA,NA,"1664462X","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE","ENGLISH",19,NA,NA,NA,"FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION",NA,"SCOPUS","IMPACT OF TEMPERATURE AND NUTRIENTS ON CARBON: NUTRIENT TISSUE STOICHIOMETRY OF SUBMERGED AQUATIC PLANTS: AN EXPERIMENT AND META-ANALYSIS","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018886301&doi=10.3389%2ffpls.2017.00655&partnerID=40&md5=a0008f703dd50d1e3fee1915cb95704d","8",2017,"NETHERLANDS INSTITUTE OF ECOLOGY;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"VELTHUIS M, 2017, FRONT PLANT SCI","VELTHUIS M, 2017, FRONT PLANT SCI"

WE STUDY HOW CAR MANUFACTURERS COMBINE AND CHANGE THEIR INNOVATION AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES IN RESPONSE TO A TECHNOLOGY-FORCING REGULATION. WE APPLY A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK ON CORPORATE RESPONSES TO PUBLIC INNOVATION POLICY TO THE CASE OF THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MANDATE OVER THE PERIOD 1990-2013. WE USE PATENT AND SALES DATA TO OPERATIONALIZE THE R&D AND COMMERCIALIZATION ASPECTS OF INNOVATION STRATEGIES, WHILE USING CORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES DATA TO OPERATIONALIZE POLITICAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES. WE FIND THAT FIRST, CAR MANUFACTURERS USED SPECIFIC COMBINATIONS OF INNOVATION AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES, DEPENDING ON THEIR VALUE MAINTAINING OR VALUE CREATING NATURE. SECOND, MANUFACTURERS CHANGED THEIR STRATEGIES AND BECAME MORE VALUE CREATING OVER TIME, WHICH SUPPORTED SOCIO-TECHNICAL CHANGE.

HORIZ","TRANSP. RES. PART D TRANSP. ENVIRON.","CARSHARING IS REGARDED TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE TRANSITION TOWARDS A MORE SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY SYSTEM BY CHANGING HOW CARS ARE USED AND TRANSPORTATION NEEDS ARE MET. CARSHARING ADOPTERS OWN LESS CARS, RIDE LESS CAR KILOMETERS AND DEPEND ON MULTIPLE TRANSPORTATION MODES FOR THEIR TRAVEL NEEDS. THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING THE CHARACTERISTICS AND MOTIVES OF CARSHARING ADOPTERS. YET, STUDIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY LIMITED TO SMALL-SCALE SURVEYS, COVERING ONLY SPECIFIC CITIES OR ORGANIZATIONS AND FOCUSING ON TRADITIONAL B2C CARSHARING, DISREGARDING THE GROWING POPULARITY OF P2P CARSHARING THROUGH ONLINE PLATFORMS. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO EXTANT RESEARCH BY INVESTIGATING WHETHER CHARACTERISTICS AND MOTIVES DIFFER BETWEEN B2C AND P2P CARSHARING ADOPTERS, AND BROADENING THE SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS TO INCLUDE AN ENTIRE COUNTRY (THE NETHERLANDS) AND DIFFERENT CARSHARING PROVIDER TYPES. FIRST, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT B2C AND P2P CARSHARING ADOPTERS ARE RATHER SIMILAR IN THEIR CHARACTERISTICS BUT DIFFER IN THE FREQUENCY IN WHICH THEY MAKE USE OF CARSHARING AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT. SECOND, WE PROVIDE NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT INFLUENCE A CAR OWNER TO BECOME AN ADOPTER OF P2P CARSHARING AS A PROVIDER. WE FIND THAT CAR OWNERS WHO ALREADY SHARED THEIR CAR INFORMALLY OUTSIDE AN ONLINE PLATFORM ARE ALSO MUCH MORE LIKELY TO PROVIDE THEIR CAR THROUGH AN ONLINE PLATFORM. WE CONCLUDE WITH DESCRIBING POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF OUR FINDINGS. REGULATION SHOULD FOCUS ON SHAPING FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR A CONNECTED MULTI-MODAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM INSTEAD OF SPECIFIC REGULATIONS FOR EACH CARSHARING BUSINESS MODEL. 2019 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"TRDTF","MNZEL, K.; INNOVATION STUDIES GROUP, PRINCETONLAAN 8A, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: K.L.MUNZEL@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.001",NA,NA,"13619209","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D: TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT","ENGLISH",21,NA,NA,"276-306","ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS DIFFERENT USERS?

YET, THE PROPAGATION OF CHALLENGES AND RISKS CAN EASILY LEAD TO A FEELING OF ANXIETY AND DISEMPOWERMENT IN RESEARCHERS, WHICH WE THINK IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO IMPROVING INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN PRACTICE. THEREFORE, IN THE SEARCH OF 'BRIGHT SPOTS', WHICH ARE EXAMPLES OF CASES IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE HAD POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH INTERDISCIPLINARITY, THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE PERCEPTIONS OF RESEARCHERS ON INTERDISCIPLINARITY ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM TWITTER. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW RESEARCHERS' MANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND SUCCESSES OF INTERDISCIPLINARITY, AND, AS SUCH, DOCUMENT EXAMPLES OF BRIGHT SPOTS. THESE BRIGHT SPOTS CAN GIVE REASON FOR OPTIMISTIC THINKING, WHICH CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE MANY BENEFITS FOR RESEARCHERS' WELL-BEING, CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION, AND MAY ALSO INSPIRE AND EMPOWER RESEARCHERS TO STRIVE FOR AND PURSUE INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN THE FUTURE. 2019 THE AUTHORS.","190473",NA,"WEBER, C.T.; NORWEGIAN COLLEGE OF FISHERY SCIENCE, NORWAY; EMAIL: CHARLOTTE.T.WEBER@UIT.NO","ARTICLE","10.1098/rsos.190473",NA,NA,"20545703","ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE","ENGLISH",1,"7",NA,NA,"ROYAL SOCIETY PUBLISHING",NA,"SCOPUS","INTERDISCIPLINARY OPTIMISM?

CENTRAL TO THIS RESEARCH ARE ANALYTICAL CONCEPTS USED TO EXPLAIN ENERGY TRANSITIONS IN NORTHERN CITIES, SUCH AS THE NOTION OF SOCIO-TECHNICAL REGIMES. IN THIS PAPER, WE ARGUE FOR A BETTER RECOGNITION OF THE REALITIES OF CITIES IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH, INCLUDING THEIR DIVERSE URBAN DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. BRINGING TOGETHER DEBATES ON HETEROGENEOUS URBAN INFRASTRUCTURES AND ENERGY TRANSITIONS, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK THAT SYSTEMATICALLY CAPTURES URBAN AND INFRASTRUCTURAL HETEROGENEITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ENERGY SYSTEMS AND THEIR TRANSITIONS IN GROWING SOUTHERN CITIES. DRAWING ON A CASE STUDY ON DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA, WE DEVELOP A SPATIAL TYPOLOGY OF ELECTRICITY CONSTELLATIONS USING THREE ANALYTICAL DIMENSIONS: DELIVERY CHANNELS, THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE, AND THE URBAN SCALE. BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES OF SIX DISTINCT LOCAL DEVELOPMENT TYPES, WE REVEAL SPATIALLY HETEROGENEOUS ELECTRICITY CONSTELLATIONS AND THEIR INTERPLAY WITHIN THE CITY. WE ARGUE THAT DEBATES ON URBAN ENERGY TRANSITIONS IN ACADEMIA AND POLICY PRACTICE NEED TO MORE SYSTEMATICALLY ADDRESS THE DIVERSE URBAN DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS WITHIN SOUTHERN CITIES, THEIR CO-EVOLUTION WITH PLACE-BASED ELECTRICITY CONSTELLATIONS AND THEIR CONTEXT-SPECIFIC CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. 2021 THE AUTHOR(S)","101937",NA,"KOEPKE, M.; DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL PLANNING, PRINCETONLAAN 8A, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: M.KOEPKE@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.erss.2021.101937",NA,NA,"22146296","ENERGY RESEARCH AND SOCIAL SCIENCE","ENGLISH",3,NA,NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","RETHINKING ENERGY TRANSITIONS IN SOUTHERN CITIES: URBAN AND INFRASTRUCTURAL HETEROGENEITY IN DAR ES SALAAM","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102057479&doi=10.1016%2fj.erss.2021.101937&partnerID=40&md5=00639fa5fabfa1849ecda54e8fb0970b","74",2021,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"KOEPKE M, 2021, ENERGY RES SOC SCI","KOEPKE M, 2021, ENERGY RES SOC SCI"

EVID.","BACKGROUND: EUTROPHICATION OF AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS IS A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM IN LARGE PARTS OF THE WORLD. IN EUROPE, EU LEGISLATION (THE WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE AND THE MARINE STRATEGY FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE), INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS (OSPAR, HELCOM) AND NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO REDUCE THE INPUT OF NUTRIENTS TO FRESHWATER AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS. A WIDELY USED METHOD TO ACHIEVE THIS IS TO ALLOW WATER TO PASS THROUGH A CREATED OR RESTORED WETLAND. HOWEVER, THE LARGE VARIATION IN MEASURED NUTRIENT REMOVAL RATES IN SUCH WETLANDS CALLS FOR A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. METHODS: SEARCHES FOR PRIMARY STUDIES WERE PERFORMED IN ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND ON THE INTERNET. ONE AUTHOR PERFORMED THE SCREENING OF ALL RETRIEVED ARTICLES AT THE TITLE AND ABSTRACT LEVEL. TO CHECK THAT THE SCREENING WAS CONSISTENT AND COMPLIED WITH THE AGREED INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA, SUBSETS OF 100 ARTICLES WERE SCREENED BY THE OTHER AUTHORS. WHEN SCREENING AT FULL-TEXT LEVEL THE ARTICLES WERE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE AUTHORS. KAPPA TESTS WERE USED TO EVALUATE SCREENING CONSISTENCY. RELEVANT ARTICLES REMAINING AFTER SCREENING WERE CRITICALLY APPRAISED AND ASSIGNED TO THREE QUALITY CATEGORIES, FROM TWO OF WHICH DATA WERE EXTRACTED. QUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS CONSISTS OF META-ANALYSES AND RESPONSE SURFACE ANALYSES. REGRESSIONS WERE PERFORMED USING GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODELS THAT CAN HANDLE NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERACTION EFFECTS. RESULTS: SEARCHES GENERATED 5853 UNIQUE RECORDS. AFTER SCREENING ON RELEVANCE AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL, 93 ARTICLES INCLUDING 203 WETLANDS WERE USED FOR DATA EXTRACTION. MOST OF THE WETLANDS WERE SITUATED IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA. THE REMOVAL RATE OF BOTH TOTAL NITROGEN (TN) AND TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP) IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE LOADING RATE. SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WERE ALSO FOUND FOR ANNUAL AVERAGE AIR TEMPERATURE (T) AND WETLAND AREA (A). MEDIAN REMOVAL RATES OF TN AND TP WERE 93 AND 1.2 G M-2 YEAR-1, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVAL EFFICIENCY FOR TN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH HYDROLOGIC LOADING RATE (HLR) AND T, AND THE MEDIAN WAS 37 %, WITH A 95 % CONFIDENCE INTERVAL OF 29-44 %. REMOVAL EFFICIENCY FOR TP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH INLET TP CONCENTRATION, HLR, T, AND A. MEDIAN TP REMOVAL EFFICIENCY WAS 46 % WITH A 95 % CONFIDENCE INTERVAL OF 37-55 %. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SMALL DIFFERENCES IN AVERAGE VALUES BETWEEN THE TWO QUALITY CATEGORIES, THE VARIATION IS CONSIDERABLY SMALLER AMONG HIGH QUALITY STUDIES COMPARED TO STUDIES WITH LOWER QUALITY. THIS SUGGESTS THAT PART OF THE LARGE VARIATION BETWEEN STUDIES MAY BE EXPLAINED BY LESS RIGOROUS STUDY DESIGNS. CONCLUSIONS: ON AVERAGE, CREATED AND RESTORED WETLANDS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE TRANSPORT OF TN AND TP IN TREATED WASTEWATER AND URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF, AND MAY THUS BE EFFECTIVE IN EFFORTS TO COUNTERACT EUTROPHICATION. HOWEVER, RESTORED WETLANDS ON FORMER FARMLAND WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EFFICIENT THAN OTHER WETLANDS AT TP REMOVAL. IN ADDITION, WETLANDS WITH PRECIPITATION-DRIVEN HLRS AND/OR HYDROLOGIC PULSING SHOW SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER TP REMOVAL EFFICIENCIES COMPARED TO WETLANDS WITH CONTROLLED HLRS. LOADING RATE (INLET CONCENTRATIONS HYDRAULIC LOADING RATES) NEEDS TO BE CAREFULLY ESTIMATED AS PART OF THE WETLAND DESIGN. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED ON THE EFFECTS OF HYDROLOGIC PULSING ON WETLANDS. THERE IS ALSO A LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR LONG-TERM (&GT;20 YEARS) PERFORMANCE OF WETLANDS. 2016 LAND ET AL.","5",NA,"LAND, M.; MISTRA EVIEM, BOX 24218, SWEDEN; EMAIL: MAGNUS.LAND@EVIEM.SE","REVIEW","10.1186/s13750-016-0060-0",NA,NA,"20472382","ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE","ENGLISH",73,"1",NA,NA,"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.",NA,"SCOPUS","HOW EFFECTIVE ARE CREATED OR RESTORED FRESHWATER WETLANDS FOR NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL?

CLIM.","WARM SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) BIASES IN THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC OCEAN FORM A LONGSTANDING PROBLEM IN COUPLED GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (CGCMS). CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINS OF THESE BIASES AND ALLEVIATE THEM HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN, BUT STATE-OF-THE-ART CGCMS STILL SUFFER FROM BIASES THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE GENERATION OF MODELS BEFORE. IN THIS STUDY, WE USE A POWERFUL COMBINATION OF IN SITU MOORED BUOY OBSERVATIONS AND A NEW COUPLED OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE SINGLE-COLUMN MODEL (SCM) WITH PARAMETERIZATION THAT IS IDENTICAL TO THAT OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL CGCM TO INVESTIGATE THE SST BIAS. WE PLACE THE SCM AT THE LOCATION OF A PREDICTION AND RESEARCH MOORED ARRAY IN THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC (PIRATA) MOORING IN THE SOUTHEASTERN TROPICAL ATLANTIC, WHERE LARGE SST BIASES OCCUR IN CGCMS. THE SCM VERSION OF THE EC-EARTH STATE-OF-THE-ART COUPLED GCM PERFORMS WELL FOR THE FIRST FIVE DAYS OF THE SIMULATION. THEN, IT DEVELOPS AN SST BIAS THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF ITS THREE-DIMENSIONAL COUNTERPART. THROUGH A SERIES OF SENSITIVITY EXPERIMENTS WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SST BIAS CAN BE REDUCED BY 70%. WE ACHIEVE THIS RESULT BY ENHANCING THE TURBULENT VERTICAL OCEAN MIXING EFFICIENCY IN THE OCEAN PARAMETERIZATION SCHEME. THE UNDER-REPRESENTATION OF VERTICAL MIXING IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL CGCMS IS A CANDIDATE FOR CAUSING THE WARM SST BIAS. WE FURTHER SHOW THAT SURFACE SHORTWAVE RADIATION DOES NOT CAUSE THE SST BIAS AT THE LOCATION OF THE PIRATA MOORING. RATHER, A WARM ATMOSPHERIC NEAR-SURFACE TEMPERATURE BIAS AND A WET MOISTURE BIAS CONTRIBUTE TO IT. STRONGLY NUDGING THE ATMOSPHERE TO PROFILES FROM REANALYSIS DATA REDUCES THE SST BIAS BY 40%. 2020 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY.

IN 2015, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) DEVELOPED A GLOBAL ACTION PLAN FOR ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE WITH ONE OF ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES BEING TO STRENGTHEN KNOWLEDGE THROUGH SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH. WITH RESPECT TO A STRATEGIC RESEARCH AGENDA ON WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE AND AMR, WHO ORGANIZED A WORKSHOP TO SOLICIT INPUT BY SCIENTISTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THE WORKSHOP RESULTED IN THREE MAIN CONCLUSIONS. THE FIRST CONCLUSION WAS THAT GUIDANCE IS NEEDED ON HOW TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF AMR TO HUMANS VIA THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO INTRODUCE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION MEASURES. SECOND, HUMAN EXPOSURE TO AMR VIA WATER AND ITS HEALTH IMPACT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND QUANTIFIED, IN ORDER TO COMPARE WITH OTHER HUMAN EXPOSURE ROUTES, SUCH AS DIRECT TRANSMISSION OR VIA FOOD CONSUMPTION. FINALLY, A UNIFORM AND GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE STRATEGY THAT COMPLEMENTS EXISTING STRATEGIES AND INCLUDES ANALYTICAL METHODS THAT CAN BE USED IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES TOO, IS NEEDED TO MONITOR THE MAGNITUDE AND DISSEMINATION OF AMR. 2017 THE AUTHORS.",NA,NA,"DE RODA HUSMAN, A.M.; NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT (RIVM), P.O.

PALAEOCLIMATOL. PALAEOECOL.","SCLEROCHRONOLOGY MAKES USE OF (FOSSIL) SHELL-ARCHIVES TO ESTABLISH RECORDS ALLOWING FOR INVESTIGATION OF HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMICS. NEVERTHELESS, THIS POTENTIAL CAN OFTEN NOT BE FULLY EXPLOITED DUE TO THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN PALEOENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY, VITAL EFFECTS AND THE POTENTIAL DIAGENETIC MODIFICATION OF SKELETAL MATERIALS, WHICH OFTEN RESULTS IN HIGHLY COMPLEX RECORDS. A NOVEL DYNAMIC APPROACH, AIMING TO SEPARATE PRISTINE FROM ALTERED SHELL MATERIAL FOR PALEOCLIMATE AND PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTIONS IS PROPOSED. SEVENTEEN FOSSIL BIVALVE SHELLS (REQUIENIID RUDISTS, PECTINIDS AND CHONDRODONTS) FROM TWO NEIGHBOURING LOWER CRETACEOUS (ALBIAN) SHALLOW-WATER SECTIONS (LUSITANIAN BASIN, WESTERN PORTUGAL) WERE ANALYSED FOR THEIR MAJOR AND TRACE ELEMENTAL COMPOSITIONS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION QUANTITATIVE XRF LINE SCANS. THEIR COMPLEX RECORDS WERE SUBJECT TO A NOVEL STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOL, WHICH TESTED MONO- AND MULTI-SPECIES DATASETS, AS WELL AS COMPARING SHELLS FROM BOTH LOCATIONS. CHARACTERISTIC ELEMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS REVEAL THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF EARLY AND LATE DIAGENETIC ALTERATION PROCESSES. THE INCORPORATION OF ELEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH DETRITAL CONTRIBUTION (FE, SI, AL) IS ATTRIBUTED TO SYN-DEPOSITIONAL BIOEROSION (SHELL-BORING). IN CLEAR CONTRAST, SHELL-PORTIONS SHOWING A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN FE AND MN ARE INDICATIVE OF LATER DIAGENETIC ALTERATION. THE INFLUENCE OF EACH PROCESS IS DIFFERENT AT EACH SITE, REVEALING LOCAL DIFFERENTIAL ALTERATION PATHWAYS. MONO-SPECIFIC COMPARISONS PROVIDES IDENTICAL GEOCHEMICAL RESPONSES, SUGGESTING THAT INTRA-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES DO NOT CONTROL THE OBSERVED ELEMENTAL PATTERNS. IN CONTRAST, INTER-SPECIES TESTS RENDERED A CLEAR SEPARATION IN THE WAY ELEMENTS ARE INCORPORATED IN THE SHELLS OF PECTINIDS AND REQUIENIIDS (E.G., AS EVIDENCED BY DIFFERENCES IN MG OR SR CONTENT). SUCH DIFFERENCES CAN BE LINKED TO DIFFERENTIAL BIOMINERALIZATION PATHWAYS, EASILY DETECTED BY THE APPLIED METHOD. WE PRESENT A NEW, DYNAMIC METHOD FOR DISTINGUISHING PRISTINE FROM ALTERED SHELL MATERIAL, NOT RELYING ON ARBITRARY DIAGENETIC THRESHOLDS FOR TRACE ELEMENT CONTENT. BY CLEARLY IDENTIFYING SHELL-ALTERATION PATHWAYS, SYN- TO POST-DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES ARE RECOGNIZED.

ECOL.","SUMMARY: HIGHER SPECIES DIVERSITY CAN IMPROVE COMMUNITY PERFORMANCE WITHIN A SPECIES GUILD WHEN DIFFERENT SPECIES COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER IN THEIR USE OF THE AVAILABLE NICHE, SUCH AS THROUGH RESOURCE PARTITIONING. HOWEVER, SPECIES IN ONE GUILD OF ORGANISMS MAY ACT AS RESOURCES FOR ANOTHER SUCH THAT THE DIVERSITY IN ONE GUILD ALTERS THE REALIZED NICHE FOR SPECIES IN ANOTHER. YET, IT REMAINS LARGELY UNTESTED AS TO WHETHER DIVERSITY IN ONE GUILD OF ORGANISMS INFLUENCES SPECIES COMPLEMENTARITY IN ANOTHER. THE PRODUCTIVITY AND DIVERSITY IN PLANT AND ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL (AM) FUNGAL COMMUNITIES CAN BE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH THEIR TYPICALLY MUTUALISTIC EXCHANGE OF RESOURCES. HERE, WE UTILIZED THESE TWO INTERACTING SPECIES GUILDS TO DETERMINE WHETHER GREATER DIVERSITY IN ONE INFLUENCES SPECIES COMPLEMENTARITY IN THE OTHER. THIS WAS PERFORMED BY CREATING MONOCULTURES AND A MIXTURE OF A GRASS, FORB AND LEGUME IN A FULL FACTORIAL DESIGN WITH MONOCULTURES AND A MIXTURE OF FOUR AM FUNGI. THE PRESENCE OF AM FUNGI REDUCED DIFFERENCES IN THE PERFORMANCE AMONG PLANT SPECIES AND GREATER DIVERSITY OF FUNGI GENERALLY IMPROVED PLANT PRODUCTIVITY OVER THE AVERAGE OF THE FUNGAL MONOCULTURES. HOWEVER, PLANT SPECIES COMPLEMENTARITY WAS NOT GREATEST WITH A HIGHER DIVERSITY OF FUNGI AND WAS ONLY POSITIVE WITH A PARTICULAR FUNGAL MONOCULTURE. AM FUNGAL ABUNDANCE WAS NOT AFFECTED BY PLANT DIVERSITY, BUT WAS GREATLY REDUCED IN THE GRASS MONOCULTURE COMPARED TO THE OTHER PLANT COMMUNITIES. VARIATION IN FUNGAL COMPLEMENTARITY AMONG PLANT COMMUNITIES WAS LOW OVERALL AND WAS LITTLE INFLUENCED BY PLANT DIVERSITY. SYNTHESIS. USING A MODEL PLANT-MYCORRHIZAL SYSTEM, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE COMPOSITION RATHER THAN THE DIVERSITY OF SPECIES WITHIN ONE GUILD MAY BE MORE INFLUENTIAL IN DETERMINING HOW SPECIES FUNCTION WITHIN AN ASSOCIATED SPECIES GUILD. HOWEVER, OUR MODEL SYSTEM DOES NOT REPRESENT A BROAD GRADIENT OF DIVERSITY IN EITHER PLANT OR FUNGAL COMMUNITIES AND ONLY ASSESSES THE INITIAL GROWTH PHASE. NONETHELESS, OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT CHANGES IN SPECIES COMPOSITIONS IN ONE SPECIES GUILD CAN AFFECT THE FUNCTIONING OF SPECIES DIVERSITY IN ANOTHER. 2015 BRITISH ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY.",NA,"JECOA","WAGG, C.; INSTITUTE OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF ZRICH, WINTERTHURESTRASSE 190, SWITZERLAND","ARTICLE","10.1111/1365-2745.12452",NA,NA,"00220477","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","ENGLISH",26,"5",NA,"1233-1244","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","COMPLEMENTARITY IN BOTH PLANT AND MYCORRHIZAL FUNGAL COMMUNITIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INCREASED BY DIVERSITY IN THE OTHER","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939501706&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2745.12452&partnerID=40&md5=a50ba02393df37a9b3b3537e102b3b94","103",2015,"UNIVERSITY OF ZRICH;INSTITUTE FOR SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCES;INSTITUTE OF MICROBIOLOGY;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF ZRICH",NA,"WAGG C, 2015, J ECOL","WAGG C, 2015, J ECOL"

GEOCHEM.","AS COASTAL LOWLANDS ARE PRONE TO SEA WATER FLOODING, SEA-LEVEL RISE MIGHT GLOBALLY INCREASE THIS RISK. TO PROTECT ITS COASTLINE, THE NETHERLANDS ADDS AN AVERAGE OF 12 MILLION M3 OF SAND ANNUALLY, BUT MORE IS NEEDED TO COPE WITH THE EXPECTED CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL WARMING. IN 2011 A NOVEL APPROACH FOR COASTAL PROTECTION WAS APPLIED NEAR THE HAGUE, CONSISTING OF A MEGA BEACH NOURISHMENT OF 21.5 MILLION M3 OF SAND: THE SAND ENGINE AN ARTIFICIAL SAND SPIT RISING TO 6M ABOVE MEAN SEA LEVEL. IT UNIQUELY COMBINES COASTAL ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS. TO CONSTRUCT THE SAND ENGINE, MATERIAL WAS USED FROM THE SEAFLOOR, WHICH CHANGED THE MATERIALS ENVIRONMENT FROM ANAEROBIC TO AEROBIC, TRIGGERING TWO MAIN HYDROGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES: PYRITE OXIDATION AND GROUNDWATER FRESHENING. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE SEDIMENT GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE SAND ENGINE AND UNDERSTAND THE HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY WITH RESPECT TO PYRITE OXIDATION AND FRESHENING. WHEN SUFFICIENT BUFFER CAPACITY IS LACKING, THE MOBILITY OF METALS AND METALLOIDS ORIGINATED FROM THE MINERAL PYRITE, CAN CAUSE LOCAL IMPACTS ON ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT. GEOCHEMICAL AND MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED ON 174 SEDIMENT SAMPLES FROM THE SAND ENGINE AND FROM MATERIAL COLLECTED FROM THE SEAFLOOR PRIOR TO ITS CONSTRUCTION, AS WELL AS ON 86 SAMPLES OF PORE WATER COLLECTED FROM THE SAND ENGINE. FIRST, A CLUSTER ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED, USING MODEL-BASED (MCLUST) AND VARIABLE CLUSTERING. SECOND, A ROBUST FACTOR ANALYSES (RFA) WAS USED TO EXPLAIN THE VARIATION BETWEEN THE GROUPS AND DISCOVER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ELEMENTS AND/OR SOIL PROPERTIES WITHIN THE GROUPS. WE DISTINGUISHED THREE CLUSTERS OF SEDIMENT SAMPLES AND TWO CLUSTERS OF PORE WATER SAMPLES. SEDIMENT CLUSTER 1 WAS COMPRISED EXCLUSIVELY OF SURFACE SAMPLES FROM THE SAND ENGINE; IT WAS DIFFERENTIATED FROM THE OTHER TWO CLUSTERS BY ITS GEOCHEMISTRY, SORTING PROCESSES AND WEATHERING. SEDIMENT CLUSTERS 2 CONSISTED OF SHALLOW SAMPLES FROM THE SAND ENGINE, AS WELL AS DEEPER AUTOCHTHONE MATERIAL FROM THE SAND PIT. SEDIMENT CLUSTER 3 CONTAINED DEEPER SAMPLES FROM THE SAND ENGINE AND ALSO SHALLOW AUTOCHTHONE MATERIAL FROM THE SAND PIT. SEDIMENT CLUSTERS 2 AND 3 SHOW DIFFERENCES IN CARBONATE CONTENT AND, ESPECIALLY, IN REACTIVE IRON, CONFIRMING THAT IN THE SAND PIT AREA A HOLOCENE MARINE LAYER OVERLIES PLEISTOCENE FLUVIAL SAND. FOR THE PORE WATER SAMPLES, TWO CLUSTERS WERE ESTIMATED: A SALINE WATER CLUSTER AND A FRESH WATER CLUSTER. THUS THE SAND ENGINE CONTAINS SOURCE MATERIAL FROM TWO DIFFERENT GEOLOGICAL LAYERS, WHICH VARY IN THEIR REACTIVE IRON CONCENTRATION AND CARBONATE MINERALS. PYRITE OXIDATION IS SEEN WITH DEPTH, RESULTING IN IRON OXIDES AND AN INCREASE IN ALKALINITY BECAUSE OF CALCITE DISSOLUTION. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAND ENGINE SOURCE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO SHOW A DECREASE IN PYRITE OXIDATION, BECAUSE OF LOW AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SULPHIDE MINERALS. CARBONATE DISSOLUTION DUE TO PYRITE OXIDATION WILL THEN DECREASE AS WELL. ADDITIONAL CALCITE DISSOLUTION IS CAUSED BY FRESHENING PROCESSES. WITH THE AMOUNT OF CACO3 PRESENT IN THE SAND, THE SAND ENGINE CONTAINS CALCAREOUS-RICH SAND WHERE ACIDIC CONDITIONS ARE NOT LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING ITS LIFE SPAN AND THEREFORE CREATE NO LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS FOR ACIDIFICATION. AT THE SURFACE OF THE MEGA BEACH NOURISHMENT, SORTING PROCESSES ARE CAUSING LOCALLY ENRICHMENT OF IRON OXIDES AND ASSOCIATED ELEMENTS, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN THE STABILITY OF HEAVY MINERALS LIKE RUTILE. 2017 THE AUTHORS",NA,"APPGE","PIT, I.R.; COPERNICUS INSTITUTE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: I.R.PIT@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.02.003",NA,NA,"08832927","APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY","ENGLISH",6,NA,NA,"72-89","ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY OF A MEGA BEACH NOURISHMENT IN THE NETHERLANDS: MONITORING FRESHENING AND OXIDATION PROCESSES","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015423165&doi=10.1016%2fj.apgeochem.2017.02.003&partnerID=40&md5=c41bf1d6b9e61f1a22ba128b67597e1f","80",2017,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;COPERNICUS INSTITUTE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT;NOTREPORTED",NA,"PIT IR, 2017, APPL GEOCHEM","PIT IR, 2017, APPL GEOCHEM"

RES. LETT.","MANY GLACIERS IN THE NORTHWEST OF HIGH MOUNTAIN ASIA (HMA) SHOW AN ALMOST ZERO OR POSITIVE MASS BALANCE, DESPITE THE GLOBAL TREND OF MELTING GLACIERS. THIS PHENOMENON IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE KARAKORAM ANOMALY, ALTHOUGH STRONGEST POSITIVE MASS BALANCES CAN BE FOUND IN THE KUNLUN SHAN MOUNTAIN RANGE, NORTHEAST OF THE KARAKORAM. USING A REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL, IN COMBINATION WITH A MOISTURE-TRACKING MODEL, WE SHOW THAT THE INCREASE IN IRRIGATION INTENSITY IN THE LOWLANDS SURROUNDING HMA, PARTICULARLY IN THE TARIM BASIN, CAN LOCALLY COUNTER THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING ON GLACIERS IN KUNLUN SHAN, AND PARTS OF PAMIR AND NORTHERN TIBET, THROUGH AN INCREASE IN SUMMER SNOWFALL AND DECREASE IN NET RADIANCE. IRRIGATION CAN THUS AFFECT THE REGIONAL CLIMATE IN A WAY THAT FAVORS GLACIER GROWTH, AND FUTURE PROJECTIONS OF GLACIER MELT, WHICH MAY IMPACT MILLIONS OF INHABITANTS SURROUNDING HMA, WILL NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PREDICTED CHANGES IN IRRIGATION INTENSITY. 2018.

MODELING THE IMPACT OF STPS ON SUSCEPTIBLE FUNCTIONS OF THE SURFACE WATER SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR A SPATIALLY SMART IMPLEMENTATION OF ABATEMENT OPTIONS AT, OR IN THE SERVICE AREA OF, STPS.THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON A NATION-WIDE SCALE FOR THE NETHERLANDS. POINT SOURCE EMISSIONS INCLUDED WERE 345 DUTCH STPS AND NINE RIVERS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. THE DUTCH SURFACE WATERS WERE REPRESENTED BY 2511 SURFACE WATER UNITS. MODELING WAS PERFORMED FOR TWO EXTREME DISCHARGE CONDITIONS. MONITORING DATA OF 7 LOCATIONS ALONG THE RIVERS RHINE AND MEUSE FALL MOSTLY WITHIN THE RANGE OF MODELED CONCENTRATIONS. HALF OF THE ABSTRACTED VOLUMES OF RAW WATER FOR DRINKING WATER PRODUCTION, AND A QUARTER OF THE NATURA 2000 AREAS (EUROPEAN UNION NATURE PROTECTION AREAS) HOSTED BY THE SURFACE WATERS, ARE INFLUENCED BY STPS AT LOW DISCHARGE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TOTAL IMPACT OF ALL DUTCH STPS DURING BOTH DISCHARGE CONDITIONS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO ONLY 19% OF THE STPS WITH REGARD TO THE DRINKING WATER FUNCTION, AND TO 39% OF THE STPS WITH REGARD TO THE NATURA 2000 FUNCTION.ATTRIBUTING WATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES TO STPS AS ONE OF THE POSSIBLE MEASURES TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY AND PROTECT SUSCEPTIBLE FUNCTIONS CAN BE DONE IN A SPATIALLY SMART AND COST-EFFECTIVE WAY, USING CONSUMPTION-BASED DETAILED HYDROLOGICAL AND WATER QUALITY MODELING. 2015 ELSEVIER LTD.",NA,"WATRA","COPPENS, L.J.C.; NELEN AND SCHUURMANS, P.O.

GEOL.","SEDIMENTOLOGICAL FACIES MODELS FOR (SEMI-)ISOLATED BASINS ARE LESS WELL DEVELOPED THAN THOSE FOR MARINE ENVIRONMENTS, BUT ARE CRITICAL FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH PRESENT-DAY AND ANCIENT DELTAIC SEDIMENT RECORDS IN RESTRICTED DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. THIS STUDY CONSIDERS AN 835 M THICK SEDIMENTARY SUCCESSION OF MID-PLIOCENE AGE, WHICH ACCUMULATED IN THE DACIAN BASIN, A FORMER EMBAYMENT OF THE BLACK SEA. DETAILED SEDIMENTOLOGICAL AND PALAEONTOLOGICAL ANALYSES REVEAL A REGRESSION FROM DISTAL PRODELTA DEPOSITS WITH BRACKISH WATER FAUNAS TO DELTA-TOP DEPOSITS WITH FRESHWATER FAUNAS. SEDIMENTS CONTAIN FREQUENT HYPERPYCNAL PLUMES AND AN ENRICHMENT IN TERRESTRIAL ORGANIC MATERIAL, ICHNOFOSSILS AND IN SITU BRACKISH AND FRESHWATER FAUNAS. DELTAIC PROGRADATION CREATED THIN, SHARPLY-BASED SAND BODIES FORMED BY MULTIPLE TERMINAL DISTRIBUTARY CHANNELS, COVERING A WIDE DEPOSITIONAL AREA. THE SYSTEM EXPERIENCED FREQUENT DELTA-LOBE SWITCHING, RESULTING IN NUMEROUS THIN PARASEQUENCES. PARASEQUENCES ARE OVERLAIN BY EROSIVE REDDISH OXIDIZED SAND BEDS, ENRICHED IN BROKEN, ABRADED BRACKISH AND FRESHWATER SHELLS. THESE BEDS WERE FORMED AFTER SEDIMENT STARVATION, ON TOP OF ABANDONED DELTA LOBES DURING EACH FLOODING EVENT. A ROBUST MAGNETOSTRATIGRAPHIC TIME FRAME ALLOWED FOR COMPARISON BETWEEN THE OBSERVED SEDIMENTARY CYCLICITY AND THE AMPLITUDE AND FREQUENCY OF ASTRONOMICAL FORCING CYCLES. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT PARASEQUENCE FREQUENCIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE NUMBER OF TIME EQUIVALENT ASTRONOMICAL CYCLES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT DELTA-LOBE SWITCHING WAS DUE TO AUTOGENIC PROCESSES. WE CONSIDER THE OBSERVED FACIES ARCHITECTURE TYPICAL FOR A DELTA PROGRADING ON A LOW-GRADIENT SLOPE INTO A SHALLOW, BRACKISH, PROTECTED, SEMI-ISOLATED BASIN. FURTHERMORE, IN THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT WAVE AND TIDAL INFLUENCE, SEDIMENT PROGRADATION IN SUCH A PROTECTED DEPOSITIONAL SETTING SHAPED A DELTA, STRONGLY RIVER-DOMINATED. 2018 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,NA,"JORISSEN, E.L.; PALAEOMAGNETIC LABORATORY FORT HOOFDDIJK, BUDAPESTLAAN 17, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: E.L.JORISSEN@UU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.sedgeo.2018.03.001",NA,NA,"00370738","SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY","ENGLISH",19,NA,NA,"1-23","ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","SEDIMENTARY ARCHITECTURE AND DEPOSITIONAL CONTROLS OF A PLIOCENE RIVER-DOMINATED DELTA IN THE SEMI-ISOLATED DACIAN BASIN, BLACK SEA","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043982575&doi=10.1016%2fj.sedgeo.2018.03.001&partnerID=40&md5=e5088257fa2db504a410366a35823ebd","368",2018,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSIT GRENOBLE ALPES;UNIVERSITY OF BUCHAREST;DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","NOTREPORTED;PALAEOMAGNETIC LABORATORY FORT HOOFDDIJK;NOTREPORTED",NA,"JORISSEN EL, 2018, SEDIMENT GEOL","JORISSEN EL, 2018, SEDIMENT GEOL"

CHANGE","BIODIVERSITY FOOTPRINTS QUANTIFY THE IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEMS CAUSED BY FINAL CONSUMPTION IN A REGION, ACCOUNTING FOR IMPORTS AND EXPORTS. UP TO NOW, FOOTPRINT ANALYSES HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN APPLIED TO ANALYZE PAST OR PRESENT CONSUMPTION PATTERNS. HERE, WE QUANTIFY FUTURE LAND-BASED BIODIVERSITY FOOTPRINTS ASSOCIATED WITH THREE DIVERGING SHARED SOCIO-ECONOMIC PATHWAYS (SSPS), USING LOSS IN BIODIVERSITY INTACTNESS INDEX (BII) AS AN INDICATOR OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS. FOR EACH SSP, WE RETRIEVED SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND LAND USE PROJECTIONS TO 2100 FROM THE IMAGE-MAGNET MODEL AND CALCULATED ASSOCIATED BIODIVERSITY FOOTPRINTS FOR SEVEN AGGREGATED WORLD REGIONS. WE THEN COMPARED THESE WITH THE FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY COMPONENT OF THE BIOSPHERE INTEGRITY PLANETARY BOUNDARY. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE GLOBAL LAND-BASED BIODIVERSITY IMPACT STAYS BELOW THE BOUNDARY (TENTATIVELY SET AT 90% OF ORIGINAL BII) IN ALL SCENARIO-YEAR COMBINATIONS. CONTRASTINGLY, THE PER CAPITA BOUNDARY IS TRANSGRESSED IN ONE, FOUR AND FIVE OUT OF THE SEVEN WORLD REGIONS IN 2100 FOR SSP1 (SUSTAINABILITY), SSP2 (MIDDLE OF THE ROAD) AND SSP3 (REGIONAL RIVALRY), RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS INDICATE A STRONG DIFFERENCE IN THE BIODIVERSITY IMPACT OF FINAL CONSUMPTION BETWEEN THE REGIONS AND BETWEEN SSPS. EVEN IN THE SUSTAINABILITY SCENARIO, THE PER CAPITA BIODIVERSITY FOOTPRINT OF CONSUMPTION IN NORTH AMERICA NEEDS TO BE REDUCED TO MEET THE PER CAPITA BOUNDARY. THUS, POLICY-MAKING TO SAFEGUARD THE ENVIRONMENT WOULD BENEFIT FROM ADOPTING REGION-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES: FOCUSING ON REALIZING AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY GAINS IN REGIONS WITH UNEXPLOITED POTENTIAL, WHILE FOCUSING ON PROMOTING DIETARY CHANGES TOWARDS LESS ANIMAL-BASED CONSUMPTION IN REGIONS WITH LIMITED POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCY GAINS. 2021 THE AUTHORS","102304","GECHE","HUIJBREGTS, M.A.J.; DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE, P.O.

PER YEAR INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC METHANE AFTER 2006, EQUIVALENT TO NET EMISSIONS INCREASE OF ~25 TG CH4 PER YEAR. A CONCURRENT INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC ETHANE IMPLICATES A FOSSIL SOURCE; A CONCURRENT DECREASE IN THE HEAVY ISOTOPE CONTENT OF METHANE POINTS TOWARD A BIOGENIC SOURCE, WHILE OTHER STUDIES PROPOSE A DECREASE IN THE CHEMICAL SINK (OH).

AFTER UPDATING BOTH THE TOTAL AND ISOTOPIC BUDGETS FOR ATMOSPHERIC METHANE WITH THESE REVISED BIOMASS BURNING EMISSIONS (AND ASSUMING NO CHANGE TO THE CHEMICAL SINK), WE FIND THAT FOSSIL FUELS CONTRIBUTE BETWEEN 12-19 TG CH4 PER YEAR TO THE RECENT ATMOSPHERIC METHANE INCREASE, THUS RECONCILING THE ISOTOPIC- AND ETHANE-BASED RESULTS. 2017 THE AUTHOR(S).","2227",NA,"WORDEN, J.R.; JET PROPULSION LABORATORY, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: JOHN.R.WORDEN@JPL.NASA.GOV","ARTICLE","10.1038/s41467-017-02246-0",NA,NA,"20411723","NATURE COMMUNICATIONS","ENGLISH",84,"1",NA,NA,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","29263323","SCOPUS","REDUCED BIOMASS BURNING EMISSIONS RECONCILE CONFLICTING ESTIMATES OF THE POST-2006 ATMOSPHERIC METHANE BUDGET","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038848977&doi=10.1038%2fs41467-017-02246-0&partnerID=40&md5=d91bb0ccc80b2f361e569481edb9cd36","8",2017,"CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR TECHNOLOGY;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;SRON NETHERLANDS INSTITUTE FOR SPACE RESEARCH;NATIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT AMSTERDAM","NOTREPORTED;JET PROPULSION LABORATORY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"WORDEN JR, 2017, NAT COMMUN","WORDEN JR, 2017, NAT COMMUN"

J. HEALTH GEOGR.","BACKGROUND: ATMOSPHERIC DISPERSION MODELS (ADMS) MAY HELP TO ASSESS HUMAN EXPOSURE TO AIRBORNE PATHOGENS. HOWEVER, THERE IS AS YET LIMITED QUANTIFIED EVIDENCE THAT MODELLED CONCENTRATIONS ARE INDEED ASSOCIATED TO OBSERVED HUMAN INCIDENCE. METHODS: WE CORRELATED HUMAN Q FEVER (CAUSED BY THE BACTERIUM COXIELLA BURNETII) INCIDENCE DATA IN THE NETHERLANDS TO MODELLED CONCENTRATIONS FROM THREE SPATIAL EXPOSURE MODELS: 1) A NULL MODEL WITH A UNIFORM CONCENTRATION DISTRIBUTION, 2) A DISTANCE MODEL WITH CONCENTRATIONS PROPORTIONAL TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SOURCE AND RESIDENTIAL ADDRESSES OF PATIENTS, AND 3) CONCENTRATIONS MODELLED BY AN ADM USING THREE SIMPLE EMISSION PROFILES. WE USED A GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL TO CORRELATE THE OBSERVED INCIDENCES TO MODELLED CONCENTRATIONS AND VALIDATED IT USING CROSS-VALIDATION. RESULTS: ADM CONCENTRATIONS GENERALLY CORRELATED THE BEST TO THE INCIDENCE DATA. THE DISTANCE MODEL ALWAYS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE NULL MODEL. ADM CONCENTRATIONS BASED ON WIND SPEEDS EXCEEDING THRESHOLD VALUES OF 0 AND 2 M/S PERFORMED BETTER THAN THOSE BASED ON 4 OR 6 M/S. THIS MIGHT INDICATE ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE TO BACTERIA ORIGINATING FROM A CONTAMINATED ENVIRONMENT. CONCLUSIONS: BY ADDING METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION THE CORRELATION BETWEEN MODELLED CONCENTRATION AND OBSERVED INCIDENCE IMPROVED, DESPITE USING THREE SIMPLE EMISSION PROFILES. ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED - ESPECIALLY REGARDING EMISSION DATA - THESE RESULTS PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE USE OF ADMS TO PREDICT AND TO VISUALIZE THE SPREAD OF AIRBORNE PATHOGENS DURING LIVESTOCK, INDUSTRY AND EVEN BIO-TERRORISTIC RELATED OUTBREAKS OR RELEASES TO A SURROUNDING HUMAN POPULATION. 2015 VAN LEUKEN ET AL.; LICENSEE BIOMED CENTRAL.","14",NA,"VAN LEUKEN, J.P.G.; INSTITUTE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT SCIENCES (IRAS), P.O.

VEG. SCI.","QUESTIONS: FESTUCA VARIA GRASSLANDS OCCUPY EXTENSIVE AREAS IN THE ALPINE BELT OF THE CAUCASUS. IN THE TEBERDA RESERVE THE DOMINANT, NARROW-LEAVED GRASSES FESTUCA VARIA AND NARDUS STRICTA CONTRIBUTE UP TO 56% AND 22%, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE TOTAL BIOMASS OF THE COMMUNITY. HOW DOES COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE CHANGE AFTER REMOVAL OF THE DOMINANT, AND IS ANY SPECIES ABLE TO REPLACE DOMINANTS IN ABUNDANCE AND FUNCTION?. LOCATION: TEBERDA STATE BIOSPHERE RESERVE, NORTHWESTERN CAUCASUS, RUSSIA. METHODS: WE EXPERIMENTALLY REMOVED F.VARIA AND N.STRICTA (AS SINGLE DOMINANTS AND BOTH TOGETHER). AFTER 20YR OF TREATMENT WE COMPARED THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN SPECIES RICHNESS PER PLOT, ABOVE-GROUND PHYTOMASS, COMMUNITY BIOMASS-WEIGHTED MEAN SLA AND LEAF DMC, AS WELL AS THE INTER-ANNUAL DYNAMICS OF FUNCTIONAL GROUPS AND THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES. RESULTS: DOMINANT REMOVAL LED TO A DECREASE IN LITTER AFTER REMOVAL OF F.VARIA AND OF BOTH DOMINANTS, AND A DECREASE IN TOTAL PHYTOMASS AFTER REMOVAL OF BOTH DOMINANTS. BIOMASS OF DOMINANTS DID NOT RESPOND TO THE TREATMENTS, HOWEVER N.STRICTA INCREASED SHOOT NUMBER AFTER F.VARIA REMOVAL. NON-DOMINANT NARROW-LEAVED GRASSES INCREASED IN ALL THE TREATMENTS, BOTH IN BIOMASS AND SHOOT NUMBER. COMMUNITY BIOMASS-WEIGHTED SLA INCREASED IN ALL THE TREATMENTS, AND LEAF DMC DECREASED. CONCLUSIONS: DOMINANTS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ALPINE F.VARIA GRASSLANDS AND DETERMINE THE FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE COMMUNITY. SPECIES FROM OTHER FUNCTIONAL GROUPS AND, REMARKABLY, SPECIES FROM THE SAME GROUP, ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPLETELY REPLACE THEM.

THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS AT THE MEETING RELATED WITH THE MAIN RESULTS AND ADVANCES IN EXPOSOME RESEARCH ACHIEVED THROUGH THE EXPOSOMICS PROJECT; ON OTHER PARALLEL RESEARCH INITIATIVES ON THE STUDY OF THE EXPOSOME IN EUROPE AND IN THE UNITED STATES AND THEIR COMPLEMENTARITY TO EXPOSOMICS; LESSONS LEARNED FROM THESE EARLY STUDIES ON THE EXPOSOME AND HOW THEY MAY SHAPE THE FUTURE OF RESEARCH ON ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT; AND FINALLY THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF EXPOSOME RESEARCH FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT ON ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES. THE MAIN RESULTS OF EXPOSOMICS IN RELATION TO STUDIES OF THE EXTERNAL EXPOSOME AND INTERNAL EXPOSOME IN RELATION TO BOTH AIR POLLUTION AND WATER CONTAMINANTS WERE PRESENTED AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH (ADDUCTOMICS) AND ADVANCES IN STATISTICAL METHODS. ALTHOUGH EXPOSOME RESEARCH STRENGTHENS THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR POLICY DEVELOPMENT, THERE IS A NEED IN TERMS OF SHOWING ADDED VALUE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH TO: IMPROVE COMMUNICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS TO NON-SCIENTIFIC AUDIENCES; TARGET RESEARCH TO THE BROADER LANDSCAPE OF SOCIETAL CHALLENGES; AND DRAW APPLICABLE CONCLUSIONS. PRIORITIES FOR FUTURE WORK INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT AND STANDARDIZATION OF METHODOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR ASSESSING THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL EXPOSOME, IMPROVED DATA SHARING AND INTEGRATION, AND THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE ADDED VALUE OF EXPOSOME SCIENCE OVER CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES IN ANSWERING PRIORITY POLICY QUESTIONS. 2018 THE AUTHOR(S).","260",NA,"VINEIS, P.; MRC-PHE CENTRE FOR ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH, NORFOLK PLACE, W2 1PG, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: P.VINEIS@IMPERIAL.AC.UK","ARTICLE","10.1186/s12889-018-5160-z",NA,NA,"14712458","BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","ENGLISH",21,"1",NA,NA,"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.","29448939","SCOPUS","EXPOSOMICS: FINAL POLICY WORKSHOP AND STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION DAVID STIEB, CECILE BOOT, MICHELLE TURNER, OSMAR ZAIANE","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042138213&doi=10.1186%2fs12889-018-5160-z&partnerID=40&md5=8cf941d19fdaf54df270999112721148","18",2018,"BARCELONA INSTITUTE FOR GLOBAL HEALTH (ISGLOBAL);UNIVERSITAT POMPEU FABRA (UPF);CIBER EPIDEMIOLOGA Y SALUD PBLICA (CIBERESP);UNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA;IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON;INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES;FORMER WHO CHIEF SCIENTIST AND REPRESENTATIVE TO THE EUROPEAN UNION;PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND;UNIVERSITY OF BASEL;NATIONAL HELLENIC RESEARCH ASSOCIATION;WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION;EMORY UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF HASSELT;KING'S COLLEGE LONDON;COLORADO SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;IMIM (HOSPITAL DEL MAR MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE)","NOTREPORTED;MRC-PHE CENTRE FOR ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH;NOTREPORTED",NA,"TURNER MC, 2018, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","TURNER MC, 2018, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH"

RESOURCE STOICHIOMETRY, THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE STRONG EFFECTS ON THE PHYSIOLOGY AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES. YET, ITS ROLE FOR DIVERSITY-INVASION RESISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS IS STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HERE, WE EXPLORED HOW THE RATIO OF NITROGEN (N) AND PHOSPHORUS AFFECTS THE PRODUCTIVITY AND INVASION RESISTANCE OF CONSTRUCTED MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES BY A PLANT PATHOGENIC BACTERIUM, RALSTONIA SOLANACEARUM. WE FOUND THAT RESOURCE STOICHIOMETRY AND SPECIES IDENTITY EFFECTS AFFECTED THE INVASION RESISTANCE OF COMMUNITIES. BOTH HIGH N CONCENTRATION AND RESIDENT COMMUNITY DIVERSITY CONSTRAINED INVASIONS, AND TWO RESIDENT SPECIES, IN PARTICULAR, HAD STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE RELATIVE DENSITY OF THE INVADER AND THE RESIDENT COMMUNITY PRODUCTIVITY. WHILE RESOURCE STOICHIOMETRY DID NOT AFFECT THE MEAN PRODUCTIVITY OF THE RESIDENT COMMUNITY, IT FAVOURED THE GROWTH OF TWO SPECIES THAT STRONGLY CONSTRAINED INVASIONS TURNING THE SLOPE OF PRODUCTIVITY-INVASION RESISTANCE RELATIONSHIP MORE NEGATIVE. TOGETHER OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ALTERATIONS IN RESOURCE STOICHIOMETRY CAN CHANGE THE COMMUNITY RESISTANCE TO INVASIONS BY HAVING DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECTS ON SPECIES GROWTH, POTENTIALLY EXPLAINING CHANGES IN MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION UNDER EUTROPHICATION. 2018 THE AUTHOR(S) PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY.

HERE WE USE A MOISTURE TRACKING MODEL TO CALCULATE THE FOREST'S CONTRIBUTION TO DOWNWIND PRECIPITATION. SPECIFICALLY, WE CALCULATE THE INFLUENCE OF MOISTURE RECYCLING ON THE SEASONALITY OF PRECIPITATION IN THE ARC OF DEFORESTATION WITH RESPECT TO THE AGRICULTURAL GROWING SEASON. WE CALCULATED THE WET SEASON START, END AND LENGTH USING THREE SCENARIOS (A) TOTAL PRECIPITATION WITH EXISTING VEGETATION COVER; (B) WHERE WE REPLACE FOREST'S CONTRIBUTION TO PRECIPITATION BY REPLACING IT WITH THE EQUIVALENT FROM SHORT VEGETATION; (C) WHERE THE FOREST'S CONTRIBUTION TO PRECIPITATION IS COMPLETELY REMOVED. WE FOUND THAT FOREST MOISTURE RECYCLING CONTRIBUTES UP TO 40% OF MONTHLY PRECIPITATION IN THE ARC OF DEFORESTATION. HOWEVER, THERE IS A STRONG SPATIAL GRADIENT IN THE FOREST'S CONTRIBUTION TO PRECIPITATION, WHICH DECREASES FROM WEST TO EAST. THIS GRADIENT ALSO COINCIDES WITH SUITABILITY FOR DOUBLE-CROPPING AGRICULTURE. OUR SCENARIOS EXCLUDING PRECIPITATION ORIGINATING FROM FOREST INDICATED THAT FOREST IS A KEY CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE WET SEASON START. WE FOUND THAT EVEN WHEN THE PRECIPITATION ORIGINATING FROM FOREST WAS REPLACED BY SHORT VEGETATION THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE WET SEASON START IN OUR STUDY REGIONS. INTERESTINGLY THE WET SEASON END WAS MORE RESILIENT TO CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION SOURCE. HOWEVER IT IS CLEAR THAT MOISTURE RECYCLING PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING THE WET SEASON END AS WHEN FOREST'S CONTRIBUTION TO PRECIPITATION WAS ENTIRELY REMOVED THE WET SEASON END ARRIVED SIGNIFICANTLY EARLIER. THESE DIFFERENCES IN WET SEASON LENGTH WERE NOT DETECTABLE IN THE EASTERN STATES OF TOCANTINS AND MARANHO, AS MUCH LESS OF THE PRECIPITATION IN THESE STATES ORIGINATES FROM THE FOREST. OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF FOREST IN SUPPORTING DOUBLE-CROPPING AGRICULTURE IN THE ARC OF DEFORESTATION. AS AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION BY DOUBLE-CROPPING INCREASES LAND-USE EFFICIENCY, IT MAY ALSO REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR FURTHER DEFORESTATION. THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY HOW THE CURRENT FOREST EXTENT PROVIDES THIS IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICE. 2021 THE AUTHOR(S).

ENVIRON. CHEM. ENG.","ANTIBIOTICS ARE BEING USED INTENSIVELY FOR HUMANS AND LIVESTOCK WORLDWIDE AND HAVE LED TO THE PRESENCE OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE BACTERIA (ARB) AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE GENES (ARGS) IN THE ENVIRONMENT. WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS (WWTPS) HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POINT SOURCE FOR ARB&GS, AND WATER CATCHMENTS CONSEQUENTLY ARE POTENTIAL RECEPTORS OF ARB&GS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE OCCURRENCE OF ANTIBIOTICS (MACROLIDES, SULFONAMIDES, TETRACYCLINES), ARGS (ERMB, SUL1, SUL2, TETW), AND CLASS 1 INTEGRON (TARGETING THE INTEGRASE GENE), IN A DUTCH RIVER THAT RECEIVES WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT EFFLUENT. SEDIMENT AND WATER SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED DURING ONE YEAR ALONG THE RIVER. THE WWTP SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE AMOUNTS OF ANTIBIOTICS AND ARGS IN THE RIVER AS COMPARED TO THE UPSTREAM SAMPLES, OF WHICH THE ANTIBIOTICS DECREASED ONCE THEY ENTERED THE RIVER. ARGS WERE PERSISTENT IN THE WATER AND SEDIMENT FROM THE WWTP EFFLUENT DISCHARGE POINT UNTIL 20 KM DOWNSTREAM. THIS STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHT IN THE PREVALENCE OF ANTIBIOTICS AND ARGS IN A WASTEWATER EFFLUENT-RECEIVING RIVER SYSTEM IN THE NETHERLANDS. EVEN THOUGH HUMAN ANTIBIOTIC USAGE IS LOW IN THE NETHERLANDS, ANTIBIOTICS, RESIDUES OF ANTIBIOTICS, AND ARGS ARE DETECTED IN THE RIVER SURFACE WATER-SEDIMENT SYSTEM, WHICH SHOWS THAT A RIVER HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ACT AS A RESERVOIR OF ARGS. 2018 THE AUTHORS.","102245",NA,"LANGENHOFF, A.A.M.; SUB-DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY, P.O.

THESE SYSTEMS ARE AWARE OF AND ADAPT TO BOTH THE OPERATIONAL CONTEXT AND THE CHARACTERISTICS AND PREFERENCES OF THEIR USERS. DESIGNING ADAPTATION MECHANISMS THAT GUARANTEE MAXIMAL USER SATISFACTION IS CHALLENGING, DUE TO THE INHERENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN USERS AND THE CHANGING CONTEXT WHERE THE SYSTEM OPERATES. IN ORDER TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE AN APPROACH THAT COMPARES ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM BEHAVIORS IN TERMS OF HOW WELL THEY SATISFY THE PREFERENCES OF THE CURRENT USER CONCERNING NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (NFRS) SUCH AS EFFICIENCY, COMFORT, ENERGY SAVING, ETC. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE A MODEL-DRIVEN FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THE MODELS REPRESENT THE USER ROUTINES THAT THE PERVASIVE SYSTEM HELPS TO ACHIEVE. THESE ROUTINES INCLUDE VARIABILITY POINTS, THEREBY ENABLING THEIR BEHAVIOR TO BE ADAPTED AT RUNTIME IN ORDER TO FIT THE CONTEXT AND THE USER PREFERENCES OVER NFRS. OUR CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE: (1) USER-ADAPTIVE TASK MODELS, A MODELING LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE USER ROUTINES THAT ACCOUNTS FOR USER PREFERENCES OVER NFRS; (2) ALGORITHMS THAT USE OUR MODELS AT RUNTIME TO GUIDE A PERVASIVE SYSTEM IN ADAPTING ITS BEHAVIOR TO USER PREFERENCES AND CONTEXT; AND (3) AN IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF OUR TECHNIQUES. 2017, SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH GERMANY.",NA,NA,"SERRAL, E.; DEPARTMENT OF DECISION SCIENCES AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, NAAMSESTRAAT 69, BELGIUM; EMAIL: ESTEFANIA.SERRALASENSIO@KULEUVEN.BE","ARTICLE","10.1007/s12652-017-0611-4",NA,NA,"18685137","JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING","ENGLISH",6,"6",NA,"1729-1743","SPRINGER VERLAG",NA,"SCOPUS","PERSONALIZED ADAPTATION IN PERVASIVE SYSTEMS VIA NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049578747&doi=10.1007%2fs12652-017-0611-4&partnerID=40&md5=8f0ef337162fdbed07a4f5df2a60f45a","9",2018,"DEPARTMENT OF DECISION SCIENCES AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT;UNIVERSIT POLITECNICA DELLE MARCHE;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;DEPARTMENT OF DECISION SCIENCES AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT;NOTREPORTED",NA,"SERRAL E, 2018, J AMBIENT INTELL HUMANIZED COMPUT","SERRAL E, 2018, J AMBIENT INTELL HUMANIZED COMPUT"

IN LIGHT OF THIS, THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO MODEL THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE EUROPEAN ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, SPECIFICALLY ON ITS LONG-TERM RELIABILITY. A RESOURCE ADEQUATE POWER SYSTEM A SYSTEM WHERE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COVERS DEMAND IS SENSITIVE TO GENERATION CAPACITY, DEMAND PATTERNS, AND THE NETWORK STRUCTURE AND CAPACITY. CLIMATE CHANGE IS FORESEEN TO AFFECT EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS. IN THIS ANALYSIS, WE FOCUSED ON TWO DRIVERS OF POWER SYSTEM ADEQUACY: THE IMPACT OF TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS ON ELECTRICITY DEMAND, AND OF WATER INFLOWS CHANGES ON HYDRO GENERATION. USING A POST-PROCESSING APPROACH, BASED ON RESULTS FOUND IN THE LITERATURE, THE INPUTS OF A LARGE-SCALE ELECTRICITY MARKET MODEL COVERING THE EUROPEAN REGION WERE MODIFIED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MAY DECREASE TOTAL LOLE (LOSS OF LOAD EXPECTATION) HOURS IN EUROPE BY MORE THAN 50%, AS DEMAND WILL LARGELY DECREASE BECAUSE OF A HIGHER TEMPERATURES DURING WINTER. WE FOUND THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ON DEMAND TENDS TO DECREASE LOLE VALUES, WHILE THE CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS ON HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS TEND TO INCREASE LOLE VALUES. THE STUDY IS BUILT ON A LIMITED AMOUNT OF OPEN-SOURCE DATA AND CAN FLEXIBLY INCORPORATE VARIOUS SETS OF ASSUMPTIONS. OUTCOMES ALSO SHOW THE CURRENT DIFFICULTIES TO RELIABLY MODEL THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON POWER SYSTEM ADEQUACY.

ANIM. PHYSIOL. ANIM. NUTR.","SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING CAN AFFECT POPULATIONS OF BIRDS. IT REDUCES ENERGY SPENT ON FORAGING AND REDUCES THE RISK OF STARVATION, BUT IT ALSO INCREASES THE RISK OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND PREDATION. SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING MAY REDUCE SPECIES RICHNESS IF SOME SPECIES ARE BETTER ABLE TO EXPLOIT SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD RESOURCES THAN OTHERS. FEEDING MAY ALSO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE ECOSYSTEM, LEADING TO BIRD NUISANCE IN THE FORM OF DROPPINGS AND NOISE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERISE AND QUANTIFY THE RISK FACTORS AND CONSEQUENCES OF FEEDING FREE-LIVING BIRDS IN PUBLIC AREAS IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE CITY OF AMSTERDAM. IN SEVEN STUDY AREAS, THE FOLLOWING DATA WERE COLLECTED: BIRD POPULATION SIZE AND SPECIES COMPOSITION, FEEDING EVENTS, AND THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD OFFERED. ESTIMATIONS WERE MADE OF THE NUTRITIONAL ENERGY PROVIDED AND THE NUMBER OF BIRDS THAT COULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE FOOD OFFERED. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO FED THE BIRDS WERE INVITED TO COMPLETE A QUESTIONNAIRE ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF FEEDING. RESULTS SHOWED THAT SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING ATTRACTS JUVENILE GULLS AND FERAL PIGEONS, WHICH COULD IN THE LONG-TERM AFFECT BIODIVERSITY. BREAD WAS THE MAIN CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD BEING OFFERED (ESTIMATED TO BE 67% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FOOD). THE MAJORITY OF RESPONDENTS FED BIRDS SO AS NOT TO WASTE BREAD AND MEAL LEFTOVERS. IN SIX OF THE SEVEN AREAS STUDIED, AN OVERABUNDANCE OF NUTRITIONAL ENERGY WAS CALCULATED. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE CURRENT TYPE AND EXTENT OF SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING IN THE CITY OF AMSTERDAM IS NUTRITIONALLY UNBALANCED AND AFFECTS SPECIES DIVERSITY AT A LOCAL LEVEL. THE OVERABUNDANCE IS UNDESIRABLE FOR REASONS OF BOTH ANIMAL HEALTH, BECAUSE IT CAN LEAD TO MALNUTRITION, AND PUBLIC HEALTH, BECAUSE SURPLUS FOOD ATTRACTS RATS AND MAY ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON WATER QUALITY. 2020 THE AUTHORS.

PALAEOECOL.","PELAGIC SECTIONS OF THE UMBRIA-MARCHE BASIN, IN THE NORTHERN APENNINES (ITALY), HAVE PROVIDED KEY GEOLOGICAL ARCHIVES FOR STUDYING CRITICAL INTERVALS OF EARLY PALEOGENE TIME. IN ADDITION TO CLASSICAL SECTIONS, THE SMIRRA CORING PROJECT PROVIDES A NEW RECORD OF RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED SEDIMENTS (~ 120 M FROM 4 OVERLAPPING HOLES) OF THE UPPER SCAGLIA FORMATION (PALEOCENE MIDDLE EOCENE). HERE WE PRESENT A NEW HIGH-RESOLUTION INTEGRATED MAGNETO-BIO-STRATIGRAPHY OF THE ~ 93-M COMPOSITE SECTION DRILLED IN SMIRRA HOLES 1 AND 2. THE CORRELATION OF THE MAGNETOSTRATIGRAPHY TO PUBLISHED GEOMAGNETIC POLARITY TIMESCALES (GPTSS; CK95, GPTS2004, GPTS2012), AS CONSTRAINED BY CALCAREOUS NANNOFOSSIL BIOSTRATIGRAPHY, REVEALS THAT THE CORES RANGE FROM CHRON C26R TO C21N (THANETIAN LUTETIAN; ~ 60 TO ~ 46 MA). SEDIMENTATION RATES RANGE FROM ~ 0.6 TO ~ 1 CM/KYR AND ARE COMPARABLE WITH THOSE FROM COEVAL SECTIONS IN THE UMBRIA-MARCHE BASIN. THEY POINT TO SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN EXISTING TIME SCALES, WHICH MAINLY INVOLVE THE DURATION OF CHRON C23 AND SUBCHRONS WITHIN C23N AND C24N. APPLICATION OF THE AVERAGE SPECTRAL MISFIT METHOD ON THE MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY RECORD REVEALS A STRONG SIGNATURE OF ORBITAL FORCING AND ALLOWS AN INDEPENDENT ESTIMATE OF THE SEDIMENTATION RATES. THIS ANALYSIS OFFERS ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS INTO SOLVING TIME SCALE ISSUES, WHICH MAINLY CONCERN THE DURATION OF CHRON C23N. OUR RESULTS IMPLY A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER DURATION FOR C23N.2N, WHICH WOULD ACCOMMODATE THE PRESENCE OF AN EXTRA THIRD 405-KYR ECCENTRICITY RELATED CYCLE IN C23N. THE SMIRRA RECORD THUS PROVIDES NEW CONSTRAINTS ON THE EARLY PALEOGENE TIME SCALE, A KEY RECORD FOR FURTHER CYCLOSTRATIGRAPHIC AND ASTROCHRONOLOGICAL RESEARCH, AND A REFERENCE FRAMEWORK FOR PALEO-CLIMATIC AND -OCEANOGRAPHIC STUDIES. 2017 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"PPPYA","TURT, A.; DEPARTMENT OF EARTH AND LIFE SCIENCES, DE BOELELAAN 1085, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: A.TURTU@VU.NL","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.08.031",NA,NA,"00310182","PALAEOGEOGRAPHY, PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY, PALAEOECOLOGY","ENGLISH",5,NA,NA,"158-174","ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","INTEGRATED STRATIGRAPHY OF THE SMIRRA CORE (UMBRIA-MARCHE BASIN, APENNINES, ITALY): A NEW EARLY PALEOGENE REFERENCE SECTION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GEOLOGIC TIME SCALE","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029416147&doi=10.1016%2fj.palaeo.2017.08.031&partnerID=40&md5=2f354659cbdc9ca693fd18d7f06dd4f5","487",2017,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;ALPINE LABORATORY OF PALEOMAGNETISM (ALP);ISTITUTO DI GEOSCIENZE E GEORISORSE;UNIVERSITY OF URBINO;UNIVERSITY OF URBINO;UNIVERSITY OF PADOVA;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT;UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL","NOTREPORTED;DEPARTMENT OF EARTH AND LIFE SCIENCES;NOTREPORTED",NA,"TURT A, 2017, PALAEOGEOGR PALAEOCLIMATOL PALAEOECOL","TURT A, 2017, PALAEOGEOGR PALAEOCLIMATOL PALAEOECOL"

THE IMPACTS OF AM AND EM ON THE SOIL CARBON BUDGET ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE PROPOSE A METHOD TO QUANTIFY THE MYCORRHIZAL CONTRIBUTION TO CARBON CYCLING, EXPLICITLY ACCOUNTING FOR THE ABUNDANCE OF PLANT-ASSOCIATED AND EXTRARADICAL MYCORRHIZAL MYCELIUM. WE DISCUSS THE NEED TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL DATA TO USE OUR METHOD, AND PRESENT OUR NEW GLOBAL DATABASE HOLDING INFORMATION ON PLANT SPECIES-BY-SITE INTENSITY OF ROOT COLONIZATION BY MYCORRHIZAS. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DEGREE OF MYCORRHIZAL FUNGAL COLONIZATION HAS GLOBALLY CONSISTENT PATTERNS ACROSS PLANT SPECIES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE LEVEL OF PLANT SPECIES-SPECIFIC ROOT COLONIZATION CAN BE USED AS A PLANT TRAIT. TO EXEMPLIFY OUR METHOD, WE ASSESSED THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACTS OF AM : EM RATIO AND EM SHRUB ENCROACHMENT ON CARBON STOCKS IN SUB-ARCTIC TUNDRA. AM AND EM AFFECT TUNDRA CARBON STOCKS AT DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES, AND VIA PARTLY DISTINCT DOMINANT PATHWAYS: VIA EXTRARADICAL MYCELIUM (BOTH EM AND AM) AND VIA MYCORRHIZAL IMPACTS ON ABOVE- AND BELOWGROUND BIOMASS CARBON (MOSTLY AM). OUR METHOD PROVIDES A POWERFUL TOOL FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF MYCORRHIZAL IMPACT ON LOCAL AND GLOBAL CARBON CYCLING PROCESSES, PAVING THE WAY TOWARDS AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF MYCORRHIZAS IN THE EARTH'S CARBON CYCLE. 2015 NEW PHYTOLOGIST TRUST.",NA,"NEPHA","SOUDZILOVSKAIA, N.A.; SYSTEMS ECOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGICAL SCIENCES, VU UNIVERSITY AMSTERDAM, DE BOELELAAN 1085, NETHERLANDS","ARTICLE","10.1111/nph.13447",NA,NA,"0028646X","NEW PHYTOLOGIST","ENGLISH",85,"1",NA,"280-293","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","26011828","SCOPUS","QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACTS OF ARBUSCULAR AND ECTOMYCORRHIZA ON SOIL CARBON CYCLING","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940467172&doi=10.1111%2fnph.13447&partnerID=40&md5=e916c9e4b95c62d3cb1c1023f63449a5","208",2015,"VU UNIVERSITY AMSTERDAM;LEIDEN UNIVERSITY;LOUIS BOLK INSTITUUT;INSTITUTE FOR SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCES;UNIVERSITY OF ZRICH;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY;MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY;TEBERDA STATE BIOSPHERE RESERVE","NOTREPORTED;VU UNIVERSITY AMSTERDAM",NA,"SOUDZILOVSKAIA NA, 2015, NEW PHYTOL","SOUDZILOVSKAIA NA, 2015, NEW PHYTOL"

WE SHOW THAT BATTERIES WHICH ARE ONLY CHARGED WITH PV-GENERATED ELECTRICITY CAN HAVE A MEAN CAPACITY VALUE RATIO OF 50% WHEN LOOKING AT THE PEAK 1.5 GW (PEAK 8%) OF THE DUTCH POWER SYSTEM, WHEREAS A GRID-CHARGED COMMUNITY BATTERY CAN HAVE A MEAN CAPACITY VALUE RATIO OF 76%.

FURTHERMORE, THE AMOUNT OF CAPACITY THAT IS CONSIDERED PEAK LOAD HAS A LARGE IMPACT, AS WELL AS THE DISCHARGE TIME OF THE BATTERY. 2020 IEEE.","9248771",NA,NA,"CONFERENCE PAPER","10.1109/ISGT-Europe47291.2020.9248771",NA,"9781728171005",NA,"IEEE PES INNOVATIVE SMART GRID TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE EUROPE","ENGLISH",0,NA,NA,"1146-1150","IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY",NA,"SCOPUS","INSIGHTS ON CAPACITY VALUE OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS COUPLED WITH BATTERIES","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097345839&doi=10.1109%2fISGT-Europe47291.2020.9248771&partnerID=40&md5=e6c80bc09cdc6a998b5f8b92da7ec5cb","2020-OCTOBER",2020,"UTRECHT UNIVERSITY","UTRECHT UNIVERSITY",NA,"SCHRAM WL, 2020, IEEE PES INNOVATIVE SMART GRID TECHNOL CONF EUROPE","SCHRAM WL, 2020, IEEE PES INNOVATIVE SMART GRID TECHNOL CONF EUROPE"

IND. SOC. REMOTE SENS.","EXCESSIVE RUNOFF AND HIGH SOIL EROSION RATE ARE THE CRITICAL PROBLEMS IN THE HIMALAYAN TERRAIN, MAINLY DUE TO RUGGED TOPOGRAPHY AND HIGH INTENSITY RAINS. ACCURATE QUANTIFICATION OF RUNOFF AND EROSION IS THUS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE FOR TAKING APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO SUSTAIN THE SOIL PRODUCTIVITY IN THE HIMALAYAN WATERSHEDS. DISTRIBUTED, PROCESS-BASED HYDROLOGICAL AND EROSION MODELS ARE IDEAL FOR THIS PURPOSE. HOWEVER, MODEL PARAMETERIZATION IN THE RUGGED, INACCESSIBLE AND THUS GENERALLY A DATA SCARCE HIMALAYAN WATERSHED IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. THE PRESENT STUDY PRIMARILY INVESTIGATES THE APPLICABILITY OF KINEMATIC RUNOFF AND EROSION MODEL (KINEROS2) MODEL IN A HIMALAYAN WATERSHED BESIDES EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL OF SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING AND GIS IN SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED RUNOFF MODELING. THE KINEROS2 MODEL, IS AN EVENT-BASED, DISTRIBUTED, WATER AND EROSION PROCESS MODEL. IT DISCRETIZES THE WATERSHED INTO A MOSAIC OF PLANES AND CHANNELS BASED ON TOPOGRAPHY. THE RUNOFF IS ESTIMATED FOR EACH PLANE WHICH EVENTUALLY FLOWS TO ADJACENT CHANNEL AND IS THEN ROUTED TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL RUNOFF AT THE WATERSHED OUTLET. REMOTE SENSING IS PRIMARILY USED FOR MODEL PARAMETERIZATION, I.E., CHARACTERIZING THE INDIVIDUAL PLANES AND CHANNELS. OPTIMIZED DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL AND FINE-SCALE LAND-USE/LAND-COVER INFORMATION ARE GENERATED USING HIGH-RESOLUTION PANCHROMATIC AND MULTI-SPECTRAL OPTICAL AND MICROWAVE SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE RESULTING DATA ON NEAR-SURFACE SOIL MOISTURE FROM RADAR IMAGERY (ENVISAT ASAR) CALIBRATED THE INITIAL SOIL MOISTURE IN THE MODEL, WHOSE PERFORMANCE IS EVALUATED USING ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR AND NASHSUTCLIFFE THAT REVEALS THAT KINEROS2 MODEL WORKS QUITE WELL IN A SMALL HIMALAYAN WATERSHED. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT SATURATED SOIL HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY IS THE MOST SENSITIVE PARAMETER INFLUENCING THE RUNOFF COMPARED TO MANNINGS COEFFICIENT AND INITIAL SOIL MOISTURE. THE MODEL OUTPUT IS ALSO USED FOR VALIDATING THE REMOTE SENSING AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) BASED HYDROLOGIC RESPONSE UNITS DELINEATED IN A PREVIOUS RESEARCH STUDY. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE COUPLING OF REMOTE SENSING AND GIS WITH PROCESS MODELS, SUCH AS KINEROS2, CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION IN PLANNING SUSTAINABLE WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN THE HIMALAYAN WATERSHEDS. 2021, INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING.",NA,NA,"SARAN, S.; INDIAN INSTITUTE OF REMOTE SENSING, #4, KALIDAS ROAD, INDIA; EMAIL: SAMEER@IIRS.GOV.IN","ARTICLE","10.1007/s12524-020-01295-1",NA,NA,"0255660X","JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING","ENGLISH",0,"5",NA,"1121-1139","SPRINGER",NA,"SCOPUS","COUPLING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS WITH KINEROS2 MODEL FOR SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED RUNOFF MODELING IN A HIMALAYAN WATERSHED","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100138993&doi=10.1007%2fs12524-020-01295-1&partnerID=40&md5=9c9c61dfab7fdcf100440c5cbbc62a5d","49",2021,"INDIAN INSTITUTE OF REMOTE SENSING;UTRECHT UNIVERSITY;INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","NOTREPORTED;INDIAN INSTITUTE OF REMOTE SENSING;NOTREPORTED",NA,"SARAN S, 2021, J IND SOC REMOTE SENS","SARAN S, 2021, J IND SOC REMOTE SENS"
